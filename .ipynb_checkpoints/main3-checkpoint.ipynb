       "'Will The Game Stop with Gamestop Or Is This Just The Beginning? The GameStop squeeze on short-sellers is an extraordinary event in markets, where at face value, retail traders and investors have worked together in an attempt to put some of the largest wall street institutions out of business. The events can be interpreted with many viable lenses and there are ironies baked in that are pure serendipity. There has been a centrally controlled game in the global financial system in which insiders benefited while outsiders got hurt that comes to a head with a company called GameStop. The broking firm of most of the retail side of this warfare ‘RobinHood’ is literally stealing from its poor, retail investors to give to its rich, capital backers. One of the historical realities of this game has been that macro-investing – the sages of not only portfolio management, but often also sophisticated social and cultural figures – have had a hard time making money in markets now for decades. With government policy dictating markets in greater degrees since the mid-90’s, the politically connected have been more likely to survive while the sophisticated and capable have been more likely to struggle. Quantitative and high-frequency trading has entered and changed the structure of global markets with this change invited through central banking policy characterised by moral hazard. Commerce and politics has grown closer and so commercial survival has demanded a political edge. Although what I really want to talk about is how market structure has changed since 1995 and how this has contributed to the situation here, a little bit of the history is first required. Drinks on Alan The tequila crises was one of the first events in late 1994, early 1995 in which insiders were bailed out and the might of the U.S. governments political capital was used to organise $50-$80 billion USD in capital for political insiders capital at risk in Mexico.  The big moral hazard there was ex-Goldman Sachs Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin using the state ‘Exchange Stabilisation Fund’ to support a Mexican bailout that protected Goldman Sachs investments. It was Alan Greenspan presiding over the Federal Reserve at the time, meeting with the men in power with sharp suits and important titles. It probably even felt like the right thing to do. This ‘Greenspan put’ as his actions became known in the investing world, fundamentally changed the structure of markets and gave enormous knowledge and power to the politically connected.  (This concept, of a ‘Greenspan put’ refers to the willingness of the Federal Reserve chairman to protect asset prices. A put is insurance against declining asset prices in which the put seller can lose big.) Meet Victor Niederhoffer. Victor Niederhoffer is one of the most successful people alive today.  Niederhoffer studied statistics and economics at Harvard and the University of Chicago, was a finance professor at the University of California and while at college he co-founded an investment bank. Having never picked up a racquet before Harvard, Niederhoffer won the squash national junior title a year later, graduated as the national intercollegiate champion, won the U.S. nationals 5 times and defeated one of the greatest players in the history of the sport in the North American Open, becoming a member of the squash hall of fame. His investment record is tremendous, with an average of a 35% return annualised and once working for fellow legend of funds management George Soros. When it came time for his son to learn the family business, Soros sent his son to Niederhoffer. Niederhoffers books ‘Practical Speculation’ and ‘The Education of a Speculator’ are essential reading for market speculation, a ‘Reminiscences of a Stock Operator’ for the thinking man.  And with changes in how the global financial system became more political, men like Niederhoffer just don’t seem to be around anymore. Maybe they don’t exist anywhere in this limited, unnatural and politically charged environment. Because Victor Niederhoffer, one of the singularly most impressive people you may find, blew his hedge fund up in 1997 in a highly statistically improbable event, in which he sold puts that were targeted by market mechanics, rather than ‘truth’.  A new layer had been added to the Keynesian beauty contest that is global markets, in which leveraged speculators could now make the market so volatile that the entire equity market could change trajectory over a period of months to target rational, risky and forward thinking positions. Normally the type of technical work that the market completed when Niederhoffer sold his puts would prove the future direction of the market so that a speculator could reasonably presume that they were taking a strong risk-adjusted position. The trade setup that emerged in this new type of market - which I call ‘the second bite of the apple’ -is a disadvantage to people who understand markets and understand risk. It takes a professional back to school and adds a new technical layer to fundamental analysis. The market here is more leveraged, more volatile, more aggressive, better for types of trading and worse for investing. The fundamentals no longer matter; and this was demonstrated only 5 years later with what could be the largest bubble of viable assets in history was formed – the NASDAQ bubble in which household blue chip stocks today lost 98% of their value. This was new. It destroyed Niederhoffer, who was quoted by the Washington Post on the day   ‘ “I’ve made that trade hundreds of times in the past 15 years” he whispered “I believe it’s a good trade. It was a one in 2,000 shot that the market would decline like that” ‘ And it baffled many sophisticated market participants for a long time afterwards. But we can actually see a change in the market! When we consider the S&P500 before and after this event (compare A with B), we can see a fundamental change in the market structure, especially in volatility, and how aggressively the market would trade (look at the second squeeze that would almost put his positions offside a second time – if he had them!). Greenspans moral hazard of late 1994/1995 fundamentally changed the market in a new way. Extraordinary people who were never wrong in risk-adjusted terms and who understood markets were carried out of them horizontally by players with leverage, who knew your position, who were more predatory in nature, had no idea about which direction the market headed in, did not care which direction the market ultimately headed in and the people who actually understood and cared about the big picture were now, irrelevant. They would leverage a short position to 500% of the total market capitalisation of the company they were selling simply to crush it into oblivion, and were able to because of a new reality in the global financial system and a new structure in markets. Financial markets were now more poker – positioning, position size and leverage – and less fundamental – for example, what are the future cash-flows of this business? Does this matter? There is a slice of the population, and not a small slice, who would blindly exchange a Niederhoffer for the more savage trader who profited from his demise any day of the week.  Both are rich, successful and perceptibly in the same dirty business, and for a lot of people they might be thrown into the same basket. Why do they care if a hedge fund manager blows up? Well, because we submit that a new epoch of financial markets had begun. We now had a post-modernist, post-truth financial system headed by a mob characterised by a view of their own power and control in which they could manifest truth and reality as they saw fit – but mostly for their mates on the inside. Of course this was fine for the people creating the financial system, because rationalising your own status, your own righteousness in the use of power and your ability to make earth-changing decisions for the benefits of your powerful friends would feel as if things were the way they should be. Why would they care about some hedge-fund managers positions? He knows the game he was getting himself into and should be a generally astute individual, expert in perceiving and managing risk. But this new financial elite establishment DID care about hedge-fund managers losses, just that it was only specific hedge-fund managers that they cared about. In 1998, Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) busted during the 1998 Russian financial crises, losing up to $4.6 billion USD in face value of an approximately $1 billion USD fund. LTCM was founded by a former vice-chairman of Salomon Brothers (of legendary fame in bonds) and their board included Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton of Black-Scholes fame, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for their revolutionary equation in options pricing. Their strategy was extremely highly leveraged (debt to equity over 25:1) trading to lock markets up with theoretical modelling overlays onto the real-world market reality.   At face-value LTCM relied on expertise, but in practice it relied on size and reputation of the people involved, evidenced by its catastrophic failure. To cut a long story short, Alan Greenspans Federal Reserve brokered a deal to rescue LTCM with the benefactor of that deal being Goldman Sachs, who had access to the assets sold at firesale – again a benefactor of the interventions of public institutions filled with their own alumni. The Federal Reserve provided $3.6 billion USD of recapitalisation. For Victor Niederhoffer there is some circular logic that emerges here, that spites and gaslights. LTCM was a group of insiders using incredible amounts of leverage to make wrong decisions in markets. Their existence is precipitated in the dangerous new world of Greenspans Federal Reserve, yet a world in which they ultimately fail on paper, are bailed out in practice.   It spites Niederhoffer because the impact on the market as a result of their failure is the best piece of evidence that Victor Niederhoffer was ultimately wrong when the positions that he took that ended his career would have been threatened again in 1998 in this asset price collapse (his positions were challenged again in 1998, validating the argument that the aggressive, leveraged, even vicious targeting of his positions was natural after all).  But this irresponsible group, who were wrong, and who would go on to invalidate Niederhoffer, who would have been right before this fundamental change in reality and market structure, were then bailed-out, while he began rebuilding his career brick by brick. With these two famous moral hazards – of the Tequila Crises and LTCM bailout, the qualitative features of global financial markets fundamentally change. The big-picture thinkers who understand macro-level knowledge in a unique and sophisticated form give way to aggressive, predatory, leveraged, profit taking machinery.  The result had been written in, in 1995. 1995-2008 was one epoch As time went on, events in 1995 and 1998 became the Nasdaq bubble, the Federal Reserve policy response to the Nasdaq bubble became the housing bubble that led into the global financial crisis. The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 was a result of Greenspans put money and the financial institutions writing the rules for financial institutions. Bear Sterns was allowed to fail and Goldman Sachs got bailout money. Macro-investors like Niederhoffer were never less successful around this time onward, and Victor Niederhoffer blew his fund up a second time during this period. Market speculation was now more purely a highly leveraged, volatile and aggressive game in which fundamentals essentially did not matter. The politically connected were able to exploit event risk, with insider knowledge providing superior returns. The Federal Reserve now provided returns. 2008-2020 was another epoch After 25 years of this phenomenon creeping into global markets, in 2020, the public were ahead of it for the first time. During the coronavirus collapse, aggressive retail investors bought, perhaps for the first time, assets from mid-tier but professional asset managers at the low and continued purchasing until the same mid-tier managers were forced to buy back from retail significantly higher. This was, of course, in unison with aggressive professionals in investment banks (We saw this in the 2020 financial results of these firms) including Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan (this co-operation of position may also be the case with GameStop). Now in 2021 we have a new epoch: Game Stop. On the one side we have a faceless mob.  Internet-going redditors at r/wallstreetbets with an expertise in meme magic pit themselves against the out of position hedge-funds that include Stephen Cohen’s Point72, Andrew Left’s Citron Capital, Alex Flynn’s Melvin Capital, Dan Sunheim’s D1 Capital Partners, Maplelane Capital and Candlestick Capital Management and with a total value of something like $55 billion USD. The story behind gamestop is that retail investors calculated a vulnerability in market structure – not unlike the firms and traders who put Niederhoffer out of business – They saw that the highly leveraged, aggressive short position of a handleful of many billion dollar hedge funds were out of position, over-committed to the liquidity and leverage of what they were attempting. In short, the short-selling machine was wrong under the rules of the game that were established just before Victor Niederhoffer sold the family silverware and mortgaged his home to survive. The new rules would now be turned against those who had created and used them for so long.  Part of the strategy uses short-dated options, in which options traders and market makers must cover their positions, where significant leverage means that a $500 position might allow up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in short term exposure < 1 or 2 weeks, and that as the market gets closer to that price, the options market maker must purchase the full amount of the underlying asset of the options. Adding to the confusion is that the fact that the majority of these trades are through a broker called ‘RobinHood’. Established in 2013, RobinHood once published a tweet that said ‘Let the people trade! Robinhood is ‘free’ because it sells its order-flow to high frequency trading firms, with its largest partner being Citadel, a hedge fund.  Citadel has covered Melvin Capitals losses, one of the losing hedge funds in GameStop with upto $3 billion, along with the fund Point72. With Citadel financially supporting the losing hedge-funds, RobinHood banned trade in the affected stocks in the Thursday, 28th January trading session. Where it is literally named after a man who stole from the rich to give to the poor, Robinhood has stolen from the poor to give to the rich. Now there is a rumour that they require funding, and that there are serious problems in the broker-dealer network. But perhaps the bigger problem is that the cynicism of Alan Greenspan, Bill Clinton and Robert Rubin having a meeting in the white-house and deciding to spend public money to bail-out a failed Goldman Sachs deal in Mexico has now spread to the entirety of global financial market participants. The market leverage, volatility, aggression and instability that saw Victor Niederhoffer lose his fund has been normalised.  There are no fundamentals. The game, as it turns out, is pure game.  The response from r/WallStreetBets on reddit is part joker and part Count of Monte Cristo. There is little fear of experiencing losses, and they are interested in punitively claiming a moral victory while using the systems logic against it. Profit is a motive, but is almost a second tier motive. And the response from the institutional side has been, pathetic. Discord banned their r/WallStreetBets chat, RobinHood shut down trading in the assets affected, the Nasdaq said they were ‘monitoring social media’, and there was apoplexy from the establishment financial services, with hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman - who had previously been prosecuted for insider trading and came to an agreement with the SEC -  complained about retail traders getting ‘checks from the government’ (Yes, a hedge fund manager complaining that other people were getting government help) responding to a call to tax wealth as ‘a bullshit concept. It’s just a way of attacking wealthy people, and I think it’s inappropriate’. Our sober conclusion is that the global financial system may simply not survive this total moral failure of making it so plainly clear that two sets of rules exist, with this contradiction exposed at a very vulnerable time. If we are correct, and the broken structure of these markets continues to create opportunities that damage risk models, force major losses, corrupt the integrity of brokers, condemn the retail investor and cause major volatility events, we expect more and more from the financial media, whimpering about the problems that they have promoted, participated in and exploited, a broken set of over-leveraged markets weighted towards insiders, dependent on government handouts, that buries a Victor Niederhoffer while rewarding the destruction of the global market pricing mechanism.  And it’s only when the average man on the street participates in their game with their rules, that we hear a complaint, half whimper, half anger. The collective voices in the financial media carrying water for the billionaires who lost money in the game that they perpetuated,  ‘Game, Stop!’ By Thomas Kuhn, CFA  Closing Notes Back to Victor on GameStop We circle back to Victor Niederhoffer, who writes in a blog almost daily.

Public to provide food for those on higher trophic levels as bacon would say \" the public has no rite to be ahead of the form especially when the trainers are betting against them the horse that were shipped from Florida to NY. are now getting accustomed to track. https://sites.google.com/view/casinoreviews/blog/the-ideology-behind-online-casino-games… first and foremost rule \" the House Must Win\". Its not cricket the public is winning , some top feeders are losing. . the Fed is part of the infrastructure. and they have to do something to stop the public from winning. expect them to beg forbearance from fellow colleagues at Treasury and House and to do something bear. There must be a winning team in south of NY (wall street) . action must be taken. high frequency trading must continue apace,  so however, a temporary cessation of bullish profits for the public will be enough to extend reliance on agrarian ideas. A very sagacious man tweets that a agrarian woman will be yelling. I disagree. one thing we can all agree on is that the be all and end all is for the trophic levels, the sharks to eat the bass —- to be upheld even if two days may lose some gamester support. But the most telling part of Victors post that day, was the end. Victor is now 77 years old, with, as we described, many of those years spent in battle with the house, battling the Fed, battling trophic levels in which LTCM is bailed out and he goes under, seeing how the system works from a humiliating defeat, that there must be a winning team in wall street. But he has something more important to worry about now. ‘Don\\'t expect any pointed posts from me tomorrow( i try to keep them innocuous as I lose a google of followers every time i stray from the Woke.) I have 5 health procedures scheduled for tomorrow culminating in the draining of my left leg which is bigger than Game Stop rise. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Bf4-SBA2Ed8…’ and a conclusion that could be very foreboding ‘The time to stop this infernal topsy turvy market where the bags are temporarily losing to the public. and the serial correlation that supports this in part. But remember old turkey partridges adman. ITs a bull market. after two days look for bull and yet. if it goes down too much before the announcement , a stern meeting at the camp Kinsella woodworking commune may be scheduled in order to varnish a few words.’ Get well soon, Victor.

      "THE BOY WHO LIVED\n",
      " \n",
      "      M r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\n",
      "that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people\n",
      "you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just\n",
      "didn’t hold with such nonsense.\n",
      "      Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\n",
      "drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a\n",
      "very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the\n",
      "usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her\n",
      "time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a\n",
      "small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n",
      "      The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\n",
      "their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they\n",
      "could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.\n",
      "Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley\n",
      "pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing\n",
      "husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered\n",
      "to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The\n",
      "Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even\n",
      "seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they\n",
      "didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n",
      "      When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\n",
      "starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\n",
      "mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley\n",
      "hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley\n",
      "gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n",
      "      None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n",
      "      At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\n",
      "Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because\n",
      "Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n",
      "“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car\n",
      "and backed out of number four’s drive.\n",
      "      It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\n",
      "something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t\n",
      "realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There\n",
      "was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in\n",
      "sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the\n",
      "light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley\n",
      "drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was\n",
      "now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats\n",
      "couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\n",
      "cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\n",
      "large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n",
      "      But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\n",
      "else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that\n",
      "there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you\n",
      "saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\n",
      "drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\n",
      "weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that\n",
      "man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\n",
      "nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly\n",
      "stunt —these people were obviously collecting for something…yes, that would\n",
      "be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the\n",
      "Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n",
      "      Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\n",
      "ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills\n",
      "that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though\n",
      "people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\n",
      "owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\n",
      "different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit\n",
      "more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch\n",
      "his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n",
      "      He’d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\n",
      "them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know\n",
      "why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and\n",
      "he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,\n",
      "clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they\n",
      "were saying.\n",
      "      “The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”\n",
      "      “ — yes, their son, Harry —”\n",
      "      Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\n",
      "whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n",
      "      He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\n",
      "secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished\n",
      "dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back\n",
      "down and stroked his mustache, thinking…no, he was being stupid. Potter\n",
      "wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter\n",
      "who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew\n",
      "was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or\n",
      "Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at\n",
      "any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that…\n",
      "but all the same, those people in cloaks.…\n",
      "      He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when\n",
      "he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight\n",
      "into someone just outside the door.\n",
      "      “Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was\n",
      "a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\n",
      "cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the\n",
      "contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made\n",
      "passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!\n",
      "Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself\n",
      "should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”\n",
      "      And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n",
      "      Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\n",
      "stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He\n",
      "was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining\n",
      "things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of\n",
      "imagination.\n",
      "      As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw —\n",
      "and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It\n",
      "was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the\n",
      "same markings around its eyes.\n",
      "      “Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n",
      "      The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat\n",
      "behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself\n",
      "into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n",
      "      Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\n",
      "about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\n",
      "learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley\n",
      "had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report\n",
      "on the evening news:\n",
      "      “And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s\n",
      "owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\n",
      "night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings\n",
      "of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\n",
      "explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The\n",
      "newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim\n",
      "McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,\n",
      "Jim?”\n",
      "      “Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not\n",
      "only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,\n",
      "Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I\n",
      "promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people\n",
      "have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But\n",
      "I can promise a wet night tonight.”\n",
      "      Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\n",
      "Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a\n",
      "whisper, a whisper about the Potters.…\n",
      "      Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\n",
      "no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er\n",
      "— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?”\n",
      "      As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\n",
      "they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.\n",
      "      “No,” she said sharply. “Why?”\n",
      "      “Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls…shooting\n",
      "stars…and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today.…”\n",
      "      “So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n",
      "      “Well, I just thought…maybe…it was something to do with…you\n",
      "know…her crowd.”\n",
      "      Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered\n",
      "whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t\n",
      "dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about\n",
      "Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”\n",
      "      “I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n",
      "      “What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”\n",
      "      “Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”\n",
      "      “Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite\n",
      "agree.”\n",
      "      He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\n",
      "While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom\n",
      "window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was\n",
      "staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\n",
      "      Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the\n",
      "Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t\n",
      "think he could bear it.\n",
      "      The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\n",
      "Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought\n",
      "before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no\n",
      "reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well\n",
      "what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn’t see how he\n",
      "and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he\n",
      "yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them.…\n",
      "      How very wrong he was.\n",
      "      Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on\n",
      "the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a\n",
      "statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so\n",
      "much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls\n",
      "swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n",
      "      A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\n",
      "suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.\n",
      "The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n",
      "      Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\n",
      "thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both\n",
      "long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that\n",
      "swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\n",
      "bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long\n",
      "and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore.\n",
      "      Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\n",
      "street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\n",
      "busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize\n",
      "he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\n",
      "staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the\n",
      "cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”\n",
      "      He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\n",
      "silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The\n",
      "nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again — the next\n",
      "lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the\n",
      "only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which\n",
      "were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window\n",
      "now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that\n",
      "was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back\n",
      "inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat\n",
      "down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he\n",
      "spoke to it.\n",
      "      “Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”\n",
      "      He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at\n",
      "a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\n",
      "shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a\n",
      "cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked\n",
      "distinctly ruffled.\n",
      "      “How did you know it was me?” she asked.\n",
      "      “My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”\n",
      "      “You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said\n",
      "Professor McGonagall.\n",
      "      “All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\n",
      "dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”\n",
      "      Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n",
      "      “Oh yes, I’ve celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think\n",
      "they’d be a bit more careful, but no —even the Muggles have noticed\n",
      "something’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the\n",
      "Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls…shooting\n",
      "stars…Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice\n",
      "something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He\n",
      "never had much sense.”\n",
      "      “You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious\n",
      "little to celebrate for eleven years.”\n",
      "      “I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason\n",
      "to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in\n",
      "broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.”\n",
      "      She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though\n",
      "hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine\n",
      "thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared\n",
      "at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,\n",
      "Dumbledore?”\n",
      "      “It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful\n",
      "for. Would you care for a lemon drop?”\n",
      "      “A what?”\n",
      "      “A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.”\n",
      "      “No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t\n",
      "think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who\n",
      "has gone —”\n",

      "      On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the\n",

      "      “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.\n",

      "through the door. “Who’s writing to me?”\n",
      "      “No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly.\n",

      "      “It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.”\n",
      "      “SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the\n",

      "looked quite painful.\n",
      "      “Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been\n",
      "thinking…you’re really getting a bit big for it…we think it might be nice if you\n",

      "      “Why?” said Harry.\n",
      "      “Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff upstairs, now.”\n",
      "      The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\n",
      "Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where\n",
      "Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit\n",
      "into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he\n",
      "owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared\n",
      "around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera\n",
      "was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next\n",
      "door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television set, which\n",
      "he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there\n",
      "was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at\n",
      "school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because\n",
      "Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only\n",
      "things in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched.\n",
      "      From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I\n",
      "don’t want him in there…I need that room…make him get out...”\n",
      "      Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have given\n",
      "anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter\n",
      "than up here without it.\n",
      " \n",
      "Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock.\n",
      "He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on\n",
      "purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof,\n",
      "and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time\n",
      "yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon\n",
      "and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\n",
      "      When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice\n",
      "to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his\n",
      "Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s another one!\n",
      "‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —’”\n",
      "      With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\n",
      "hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground\n",
      "to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had\n",
      "grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused\n",
      "fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon\n",
      "straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand.\n",
      "      “Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry.\n",
      "“Dudley — go — just go.”\n",
      "      Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had\n",
      "moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first\n",
      "letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they\n",
      "didn’t fail. He had a plan.\n",
      " \n",
      "The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned\n",

      "downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\n",
      "      He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and\n",
      "get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the\n",
      "dark hall toward the front door —\n",
      "      “AAAAARRRGH!”\n",

      "the doormat — something alive!\n",
      "      Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big,\n",
      "squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the\n",
      "foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do\n",
      "exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour\n",
      "and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into\n",
      "the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle\n",
      "Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\n",
      "      “I want —” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into\n",
      "pieces before his eyes.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed\n",
      "up the mail slot.\n",
      "      “See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they\n",
      "can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.”\n",
      "      “I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”\n",
      "      “Oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like\n",
      "you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of\n",
      "fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\n",
      " \n",
      "On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t go\n",
      "through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the\n",
      "sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs\n",
      "bathroom.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got\n",
      "out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back\n",
      "doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he\n",
      "worked, and jumped at small noises.\n",
      " \n",
      "On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry\n",
      "found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two\n",
      "dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through\n",
      "the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the\n",
      "post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia\n",
      "shredded the letters in her food processor.\n",
      "      “Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry in\n",
      "amazement.\n",
      "* * *\n",
      "On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking\n",
      "tired and rather ill, but happy.\n",
      "      “No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread\n",
      "marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today —”\n",
      "      Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and\n",
      "caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters\n",
      "came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry\n",
      "leapt into the air trying to catch one —\n",
      "      “Out! OUT!”\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.\n",
      "When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces,\n",
      "Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming\n",
      "into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\n",
      "      “That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling\n",
      "great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five\n",
      "minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No\n",
      "arguments!”\n",
      "      He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared\n",
      "argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up\n",
      "doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in\n",
      "the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he\n",
      "tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\n",
      "      They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where\n",
      "they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and\n",
      "drive in the opposite direction for a while.\n",
      "      “Shake ’em off…shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this.\n",
      "      They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling.\n",

      "blowing up an alien on his computer.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the\n",
      "outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and\n",
      "damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the\n",
      "windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.…\n",
      " \n",

      "“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested\n",
      "timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he\n",
      "was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest,\n",
      "got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went\n",
      "again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across\n",
      "a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\n",
      "      “Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late\n",
      "that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the\n",
      "car, and disappeared.\n",
      "      It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.\n",
      "      “It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I\n",
      "want to stay somewhere with a television.”\n",
      "      Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and\n",
      "you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of\n",
      "television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course,\n",
      "his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a\n",
      "coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven\n",
      "every day.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,\n",
      "thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.\n",
      "      “Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!”\n",
      "      It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\n",
      "looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most\n",
      "miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no\n",
      "television in there.\n",
      "      “Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his\n",
      "hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!”\n",
      "      A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather\n",
      "wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.\n",
      "      “I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!”\n",
      "      It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks\n",
      "and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they\n",
      "reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the\n",
      "broken-down house.\n",
      "      The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind\n",
      "whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and\n",
      "empty. There were only two rooms.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\n",
      "bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and\n",
      "shriveled up.\n",
      "      “Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.\n",
      "      He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a\n",
      "chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed,\n",
      "though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.\n",
      "      As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the\n",
      "high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy\n",
      "windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and\n",
      "made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went\n",
      "off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor\n",
      "he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\n",
      "      The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry\n",
      "couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his\n",
      "stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls\n",
      "of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which\n",
      "was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven\n",
      "in ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if\n",
      "the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\n",
      "      Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the\n",
      "roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes\n",
      "to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got\n",
      "back that he’d be able to steal one somehow.\n",
      "      Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like\n",
      "that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the\n",

      "      “Knuts?”\n",
      "      “The little bronze ones.”\n",
      "      Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so\n",
      "Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off\n",
      "through the open window.\n",
      "      Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\n",
      "      “Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all\n",

      "had got a puncture.\n",
      "      “Um — Hagrid?”\n",
      "      “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\n",
      "      “I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night…he\n",
      "won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”\n",
      "      “Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his\n",
      "head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”\n",
      "      “But if their house was destroyed —”\n",
      "      “They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is\n",
      "Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’\n",
      "say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”\n",
      "      “Wizards have banks?”\n",
      "      “Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”\n",
      "      Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\n",
      "      “Goblins?”\n",
      "      “Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess\n",
      "with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh\n",
      "want ter keep safe — ‘cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit\n",
      "Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself\n",
      "up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you —\n",
      "gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see.”\n",
      "      “Got everythin’? Come on, then.”\n",
      "      Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now\n",
      "and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still\n",
      "there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\n",
      "      “How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\n",
      "      “Flew,” said Hagrid.\n",
      "      “Flew?”\n",
      "      “Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve\n",
      "got yeh.”\n",
      "      They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to\n",
      "imagine him flying.\n",
      "      “Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of\n",
      "his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind\n",
      "not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”\n",
      "      “Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out\n",
      "the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off\n",
      "toward land.\n",
      "      “Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.\n",
      "      “Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he\n",
      "spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high security vaults. And then yeh\n",
      "gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep\n",
      "under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did\n",
      "manage ter get yer hands on summat.”\n",
      "      Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the\n",
      "Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left\n",
      "alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many\n",
      "questions in his life.\n",
      "      “Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning\n",
      "the page.\n",
      "      “There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "      “’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’\n",
      "course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.\n",
      "Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning,\n",
      "askin’ fer advice.”\n",
      "      “But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”\n",
      "      “Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still\n",
      "witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”\n",
      "      “Why?”\n",
      "      “Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their\n",
      "problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”\n",
      "      At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid\n",
      "folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\n",
      "      Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to\n",
      "the station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as\n",
      "anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and\n",
      "saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”\n",
      "      “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say\n",
      "there are dragons at Gringotts?”\n",
      "      “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.”\n",
      "      “You’d like one?”\n",
      "      “Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”\n",
      "      They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five\n",
      "minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it,\n",
      "gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\n",
      "      People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and\n",
      "sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.\n",
      "      “Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches.\n",
      "      Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\n",
      "      “Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.”\n",

      "      “If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid.\n",
      " \n",
      "Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know\n",
      "where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary\n",
      "way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained\n",
      "loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\n",
      "      “I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they\n",
      "climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\n",
      "      Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do\n",
      "was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,\n",
      "hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell\n",
      "you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people.\n",
      "Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there\n",
      "really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some\n",
      "huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the\n",
      "Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even\n",
      "though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t\n",
      "help trusting him.\n",
      "      “This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a\n",
      "famous place.”\n",
      "      It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry\n",
      "wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it.\n",
      "Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the\n",
      "other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the\n",
      "most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could\n",
      "mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\n",
      "      For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were\n",
      "sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a\n",
      "long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was\n",
      "quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped\n",
      "when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled\n",
      "at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”\n",
      "      “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great\n",
      "hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.\n",
      "      “Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — can this be\n",
      "—?”\n",
      "      The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\n",
      "      “Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter…what an\n",
      "honor.”\n",
      "      He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his\n",
      "hand, tears in his eyes.\n",
      "      “Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”\n",
      "      Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old\n",
      "woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid\n",
      "was beaming.\n",
      "      Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry\n",
      "found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\n",
      "      “Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.”\n",
      "      “So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”\n",
      "      “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.”\n",
      "      “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus\n",
      "Diggle.”\n",
      "      “I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in\n",
      "his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”\n",
      "      “He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.\n",
      "“Did you hear that? He remembers me!” Harry shook hands again and again —\n",
      "Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\n",
      "      A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his\n",
      "eyes was twitching.\n",
      "      “Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one\n",
      "of your teachers at Hogwarts.”\n",
      "      “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-\n",
      "can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”\n",
      "      “What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”\n",
      "      “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as\n",
      "though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?”\n",
      "He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve\n",
      "g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at\n",
      "the very thought.\n",
      "      But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It\n",
      "took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to\n",
      "make himself heard over the babble.\n",
      "      “Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”\n",
      "      Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them\n",
      "through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing\n",
      "but a trash can and a few weeds.\n",
      "      Hagrid grinned at Harry.\n",
      "      “Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell\n",
      "was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.”\n",
      "      “Is he always that nervous?”\n",
      "      “Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’\n",
      "outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They\n",
      "say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with\n",
      "a hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own\n",
      "subject — now, where’s me umbrella?”\n",
      "      Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was\n",
      "counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\n",
      "      “Three up…two across…” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.”\n",
      "      He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\n",
      "      The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a\n",
      "small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were\n",
      "facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled\n",
      "street that twisted and turned out of sight.\n",
      "      “Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”\n",
      "      He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway.\n",
      "Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\n",
      "back into solid wall.\n",
      "      The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.\n",
      "Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring —\n",
      "Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\n",
      "      “Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money\n",
      "first.”\n",
      "      Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every\n",
      "direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the\n",
      "shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman\n",
      "outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon\n",
      "liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.…”\n",
      "      A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops\n",
      "Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of\n",
      "about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in\n",
      "it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand —\n",
      "fastest ever —” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and\n",
      "strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with\n",
      "barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and\n",
      "rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.…\n",
      "      “Gringotts,” said Hagrid.\n",
      "      They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other\n",
      "little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of\n",
      "scarlet and gold, was —\n",
      "      “Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white\n",
      "stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had\n",
      "a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and\n",
      "feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of\n",
      "doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\n",
      "Enter, stranger, but take heed\n",
      "Of what awaits the sin of greed,\n",
      "For those who take, but do not earn,\n",
      "Must pay most dearly in their turn.\n",
      "So if you seek beneath our floors\n",
      "A treasure that was never yours,\n",
      "Thief, you have been warned, beware\n",
      "Of finding more than treasure there.\n",
      " \n",
      "“Like I said, Yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.\n",
      "      A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\n",
      "vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools\n",
      "behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales,\n",
      "examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to\n",
      "count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out\n",
      "of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\n",
      "      “Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some\n",
      "money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”\n",
      "      “You have his key, sir?”\n",
      "      “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his\n",
      "pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the\n",
      "goblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the\n",
      "goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\n",
      "      “Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\n",
      "      The goblin looked at it closely.\n",
      "      “That seems to be in order.”\n",
      "      “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid\n",
      "importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault\n",
      "seven hundred and thirteen.”\n",
      "      The goblin read the letter carefully.\n",
      "      “Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone\n",
      "take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”\n",
      "      Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\n",
      "biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of\n",
      "the doors leading off the hall.\n",
      "      “What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?”\n",
      "Harry asked.\n",
      "      “Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts\n",
      "business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”\n",
      "      Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more\n",
      "marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming\n",
      "torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the\n",
      "floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward\n",
      "them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.\n",
      "      At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried\n",
      "to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.\n",
      "The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t\n",
      "steering.\n",
      "      Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them\n",
      "wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and\n",
      "twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even\n",
      "deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew\n",
      "from the ceiling and floor.\n",
      "      “I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s\n",
      "the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”\n",
      "      “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions\n",
      "just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”\n",
      "      He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\n",
      "door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop\n",
      "his knees from trembling.\n",
      "      Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out,\n",
      "and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of\n",
      "silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\n",
      "      “All yours,” smiled Hagrid.\n",
      "      All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known\n",
      "about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had\n",
      "they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had\n",
      "been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\n",
      "      Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n",
      "      “The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to\n",
      "a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should\n",
      "be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to\n",
      "Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more\n",
      "slowly?”\n",
      "      “One speed only,” said Griphook.\n",
      "      They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became\n",
      "colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an\n",
      "underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down\n",
      "at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his\n",
      "neck.\n",
      "      Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\n",
      "      “Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently\n",
      "with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\n",
      "      “If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the\n",
      "door and trapped in there,” said Griphook.\n",
      "      “How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.\n",
      "      “About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\n",
      "      Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,\n",
      "Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels\n",
      "at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby\n",
      "little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up\n",
      "and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew\n",
      "better than to ask.\n",
      "      “Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way\n",
      "back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.\n",
      " \n",
      "One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.\n",
      "Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He\n",
      "didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he\n",
      "was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than\n",
      "even Dudley had ever had.\n",
      "      “Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam\n",
      "Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped\n",
      "off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did\n",
      "still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling\n",
      "nervous.\n",
      "      Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\n",
      "      “Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot\n",
      "here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”\n",
      "      In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a\n",
      "footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin\n",
      "stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began\n",
      "to pin it to the right length.\n",
      "      “Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”\n",
      "      “Yes,” said Harry.\n",
      "      “My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street\n",
      "looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m\n",
      "going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t\n",
      "have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in\n",
      "somehow.”\n",
      "      Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\n",
      "      “Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.\n",
      "      “No,” said Harry.\n",
      "      “Play Quidditch at all?”\n",
      "      “No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\n",
      "      “I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house,\n",
      "and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?”\n",
      "      “No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\n",
      "      “Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll\n",
      "be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think\n",
      "I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”\n",
      "      “Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more\n",
      "interesting.\n",
      "      “I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front\n",
      "window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large\n",
      "ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.\n",
      "      “That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.\n",
      "“He works at Hogwarts.”\n",
      "      “Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”\n",
      "      “He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less\n",
      "every second.\n",
      "      “Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school\n",
      "grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up\n",
      "setting fire to his bed.”\n",
      "      “I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\n",
      "      “Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where\n",
      "are your parents?”\n",
      "      “They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into\n",
      "the matter with this boy.\n",
      "      “Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our\n",
      "kind, weren’t they?”\n",
      "      “They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”\n",
      "      “I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just\n",
      "not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them\n",
      "have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they\n",
      "should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”\n",
      "      But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done,\n",
      "my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped\n",
      "down from the footstool.\n",
      "      “Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.\n",
      "      Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him\n",
      "(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\n",
      "      “What’s up?” said Hagrid.\n",
      "      “Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry\n",
      "cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.\n",
      "When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”\n",
      "      “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’\n",
      "about Quidditch!”\n",
      "      “Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale\n",

      "      “It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world\n",

      "      “I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.\n",
      "      “Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a\n",

      "      “Vol-, sorry —You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”\n",
      "      “Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.\n",
      "      They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts\n",
      "where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving\n",
      "stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books\n",
      "full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even\n",
      "Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on\n",

      "yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh\n",
      "get ter that level.”\n",
      "      Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says\n",
      "pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion\n",
      "ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary,\n",
      "which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad\n",
      "eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs,\n",
      "dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of\n",
      "fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man\n",
      "behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry\n",
      "himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and\n",
      "minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\n",
      "      Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.\n",
      "      “Just yer wand left — A yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday\n",
      "present.”\n",
      "      Harry felt himself go red.\n",

      "      “I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad,\n",
      "toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats,\n",
      "they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead\n",

      "      Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been\n",
      "dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a\n",
      "large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her\n",
      "wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor\n",
      "Quirrell.\n",
      "      “Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta\n",
      "presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands,\n",
      "Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”\n",
      "      A magic wand…this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\n",
      "      The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door\n",
      "read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a\n",
      "faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\n",
      "      A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped\n",
      "inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid\n",
      "sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library;\n",
      "he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked\n",
      "instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For\n",
      "some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here\n",
      "seemed to tingle with some secret magic.\n",
      "      “Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have\n",
      "jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the\n",
      "spindly chair.\n",
      "      An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like\n",
      "moons through the gloom of the shop.\n",
      "      “Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.\n",
      "      “Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon.\n",
      "Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only\n",
      "yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter\n",
      "inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.”\n",
      "      Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink.\n",
      "Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\n",
      "      “Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven\n",
      "inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say\n",
      "your father favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.”\n",
      "      Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to\n",
      "nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\n",
      "      “And that’s where…”\n",
      "      Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a\n",
      "long, white finger.\n",
      "      “I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-\n",
      "and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong\n",
      "hands…well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do.\n",
      "…”\n",
      "      He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.\n",
      "      “Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.…Oak, sixteen\n",
      "inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”\n",
      "      “It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.\n",
      "      “Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you\n",
      "got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\n",
      "      “Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got\n",
      "the pieces, though,” he added brightly.\n",
      "      “But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\n",
      "      “Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink\n",
      "umbrella very tightly as he spoke.\n",
      "      “Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well,\n",
      "now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver\n",
      "markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”\n",
      "      “Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.\n",
      "      “Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to\n",
      "finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head.\n",
      "As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful\n",
      "magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and\n",
      "the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no\n",
      "two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will\n",
      "never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”\n",
      "      Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring\n",
      "between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting\n",
      "around the shelves, taking down boxes.\n",
      "      “That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the\n",
      "floor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring.\n",
      "Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.”\n",
      "      Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr.\n",
      "Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\n",
      "      “Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try —”\n",
      "      Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was\n",
      "snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\n",
      "      “No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.\n",
      "Go on, go on, try it out.”\n",
      "      Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting\n",
      "for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair,\n",
      "but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he\n",
      "seemed to become.\n",
      "      “Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here\n",
      "somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly\n",
      "and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”\n",
      "      Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised\n",
      "the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a\n",
      "stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing\n",
      "dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr.\n",
      "Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well…how\n",
      "curious…how very curious…”\n",
      "      He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,\n",

      "this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.”\n",
      "      Harry swallowed.\n",
      "      “Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things\n",

      "      He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very\n",
      "solid.\n",
      "      He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms\n",
      "nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that\n",

      "heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able to\n",
      "stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes\n",
      "ready for the crash —\n",
      "      It didn’t come…he kept on running…he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam\n",

      "heavy trunks.\n",
      "      The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging\n",
      "out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry\n",

      "      The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him\n",
      "shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\n",
      "      Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty\n",
      "compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then\n",
      "started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up\n",
      "the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his\n",
      "foot.\n",
      "      “Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed through\n",

      "      “Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”\n",
      "      With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of\n",
      "the compartment.\n",
      "      “Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\n",
      "      “What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s\n",
      "lightning scar.\n",
      "      “Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you —?”\n",
      "      “He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Harry.\n",
      "      “What?” said Harry.\n",
      "      “Harry Potter.” chorused the twins.\n",
      "      “Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.”\n",
      "      The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to\n",

      "      “Coming, Mom.”\n",
      "      With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\n",

      "      “Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.”\n",
      "      The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and\n",

      "      “He’s coming now.”\n",
      "      The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his\n",

      "chest with the letter P on it.\n",
      "      “Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects have got\n",

      "at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off\n",
      "them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of\n",
      "Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his\n",

      "      “You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When they say\n",

      "like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and\n",
      "liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.”\n",
      "      Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\n",
      "      “Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.”\n",
      "      They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,\n",

      "      “Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him…”\n",
      "      He left.\n",
      "      “Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought a toad I’d\n",

      "      “Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway —”\n",
      "      He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again.\n",
      "The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already\n",
      "wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\n",
      "      “Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a bossy\n",
      "sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\n",
      "      “We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the girl\n",
      "wasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\n",
      "      “Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”\n",
      "      She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\n",
      "      “Er — all right.”\n",

      "asleep.\n",
      "      “Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good,\n",

      "Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my\n",

      "witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of\n",
      "course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who\n",
      "are you?”\n",
      "      She said all this very fast.\n",
      "      Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he\n",
      "hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.\n",
      "      “I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.\n",
      "      “Harry Potter,” said Harry.\n",

      "got a few extra books, for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical\n",
      "History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of\n",
      "the Twentieth Century.”\n",
      "      “Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.\n",
      "      “Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it\n",
      "was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be in? I’ve\n",

      "      “That’s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”\n",
      "      “Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\n",

      "don’t think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course, everyone gets scared\n",
      "when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.”\n",
      "      Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle\n",
      "of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all\n",
      "part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying\n",
      "“Voldemort” without worrying.\n",
      "      “What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.\n",
      "      “Er — I don’t know any.” Harry confessed.\n",
      "      “What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in\n",
      "the world —” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the\n",
      "positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his\n",
      "brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just\n",
      "taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door\n",
      "slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger\n",
      "this time.\n",
      "      Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was\n",
      "the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a\n",
      "lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.\n",
      "      “Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry\n",
      "Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”\n",
      "      “Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were\n",
      "thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they\n",
      "looked like bodyguards.\n",
      "      “Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly,\n",
      "noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”\n",
      "      Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco\n",

      "      “Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My\n",

      "they can afford.”\n",
      "      He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding families\n",

      "wrong sort. I can help you there.”\n",
      "      He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it.\n",
      "      “I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said\n",
      "coolly.\n",
      "      Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\n",
      "      “I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless you’re a bit\n",
      "politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good\n",
      "for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid,\n",
      "and it’ll rub off on you.”\n",

      "into Goyle’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung\n",
      "Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit\n",
      "the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there\n",
      "were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps,\n",
      "because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\n",
      "      “What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the\n",

      "      “All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving\n",
      "very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy\n",
      "voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?”\n",
      "      Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was\n",

      "      The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their\n",
      "way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the\n",
      "cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and\n",
      "Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there,\n",

      "nervously.\n",
      "      “Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term\n",
      "banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you\n",
      "will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony\n",

      "outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will\n",
      "earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end\n",
      "of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great\n",
      "honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\n",
      "      “The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the\n",

      "      Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school?\n",
      "But he didn’t know any magic yet —what on earth would he have to do? He\n",
      "hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around\n",
      "anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking\n",
      "much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the\n",
      "spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not\n",
      "to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to\n",
      "take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his\n",

      "      Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was\n",
      "lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four\n",
      "long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid\n",
      "with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long\n",

      "up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the\n",
      "teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale\n",
      "lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students,\n",
      "the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked\n",
      "upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione\n",
      "whisper, “Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts,\n",
      "A History.”\n",
      "      It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great\n",
      "Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.\n",
      "      Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently\n",
      "placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a\n",
      "pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt\n",
      "Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house.\n",
      "      Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,\n",

      "staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete\n",
      "silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth —\n",
      "and the hat began to sing:\n",

      "For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\n",
      "And I can cap them all.\n",
      "There’s nothing hidden in your head\n",
      "The Sorting Hat can’t see,\n",
      "So try me on and I will tell you\n",
      "Where you ought to be.\n",
      "You might belong in Gryffindor,\n",
      "Where dwell the brave at heart,\n",
      "Their daring, nerve, and chivalry\n",
      "Set Gryffindors apart;\n",
      "You might belong in Hufflepuff,\n",

      "And unafraid of toil;\n",
      "Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\n",
      "if you’ve a ready mind,\n",
      "Where those of wit and learning,\n",
      "Will always find their kind;\n",
      "Or perhaps in Slytherin\n",
      "You’ll make your real friends,\n",
      "Those cunning folk use any means\n",
      "To achieve their ends.\n",
      "So put me on! Don’t be afraid!\n",
      "And don’t get in a flap!\n",
      "You’re in safe hands (though I have none)\n",

      "The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to\n",

      "      “So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill\n",
      "Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.”\n",
      "      Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having\n",
      "to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone\n",
      "watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or\n",
      "quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house\n",
      "for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\n",

      "an unpleasant lot.\n",
      "      He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked\n",

      "      And now there were only three people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,”\n",

      "of Flitwick’s class looking confused.\n",
      "      “Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on\n",

      "Potter?”\n",
      "      Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going on, but he\n",
      "didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to\n",
      "his legs.\n",
      "      “He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor\n",
      "McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t\n",

      "      “You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got\n",

      "      “I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if you\n",

      "      “Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting\n",

      "quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The\n",
      "most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you\n",

      "into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a\n",
      "voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this,\n",

      "out of Gryffindor tower.\n",

      "      The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\n",
      "      “RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not\n",

      "filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs\n",
      "of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three\n",
      "drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\n",
      "      It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew\n",
      "that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance\n",
      "had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no\n",

      "almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for\n",
      "them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly\n",
      "cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them\n",
      "and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait of the\n",
      "Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n",
      "      “Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their\n",

      "M alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still\n",
      "at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the\n",
      "next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had\n",
      "been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In\n",
      "the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been\n",
      "moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what\n",
      "could possibly need such heavy protection.\n",
      "      “It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.\n",
      "      “Or both,” said Harry.\n",
      "      But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was\n",
      "about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was\n",
      "without further clues.\n",
      "      Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay\n",
      "underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going\n",
      "near the dog again.\n",
      "      Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such\n",
      "a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted\n",
      "now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a\n",
      "thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\n",
      "      As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention\n",
      "was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.\n",
      "Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel,\n",
      "and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him,\n",
      "knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when\n",
      "another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\n",
      "      Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\n",
      " \n",
      "DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\n",
      "            It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t want\n",
      "everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver\n",
      "Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first\n",
      "training session.\n",

      "            Professor McGonagall\n",
      " \n",
      "Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\n",
      "      “A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. “I’ve never even\n",
      "touched one.”\n",
      "      They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private\n",
      "before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way\n",
      "upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and\n",
      "felt it.\n",
      "      “That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture\n",
      "of jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years\n",
      "aren’t allowed them.”\n",
      "      Ron couldn’t resist it.\n",
      "      “It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus Two Thousand.\n",
      "What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron\n",
      "grinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same league as the\n",
      "Nimbus.”\n",
      "      “What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half the\n",
      "handle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your brothers have to save up\n",
      "twig by twig.”\n",
      "      Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s\n",
      "elbow.\n",
      "      “Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.\n",
      "      “Potter’s been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly.\n",
      "      “Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.\n",
      "“Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And\n",
      "what model is it?”\n",
      "      “A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the\n",
      "look of horror on Malfoy’s face. “And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve\n",
      "got it,” he added.\n",
      "      Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy’s\n",
      "obvious rage and confusion.\n",
      "      “Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble\n",
      "staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team.\n",
      "…”\n",
      "      “So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” came an\n",
      "angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,\n",
      "looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand.\n",
      "      “I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.\n",
      "      “Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.”\n",
      "      Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.\n",
      "      Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It\n",
      "kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under\n",
      "his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that\n",
      "night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating,\n",
      "and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n",
      "      “Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.\n",
      "      Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it\n",
      "looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of\n",
      "neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\n",
      "      As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk\n",
      "toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds\n",
      "of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high\n",
      "enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden\n",
      "poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks\n",
      "Muggle children blew bubbles  through, except that they were fifty feet high.\n",
      "      Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick\n",
      "and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the\n",
      "goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand\n",
      "turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\n",
      "      “Hey, Potter, come down!”\n",
      "      Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his\n",
      "arm. Harry landed next to him.\n",
      "      “Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall\n",
      "meant…you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this\n",
      "evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”\n",
      "      He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\n",
      "      “Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even\n",
      "if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them\n",
      "are called Chasers.”\n",
      "      “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\n",
      "about the size of a soccer ball.\n",
      "      “This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw the\n",
      "Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal.\n",
      "Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?”\n",
      "      “The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,”\n",
      "Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six\n",
      "hoops, isn’t it?”\n",
      "      “What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.\n",
      "      “Never mind,” said Harry quickly.\n",
      "      “Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper — I’m\n",
      "Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team\n",
      "from scoring.”\n",
      "      “Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to\n",
      "remember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are\n",
      "they for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\n",
      "      “I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”\n",
      "      He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\n",
      "      “I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These two\n",
      "are the Bludgers.”\n",
      "      He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than\n",
      "the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the\n",
      "straps holding them inside the box.\n",
      "      “Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\n",
      "Bludgers.\n",
      "      At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\n",
      "Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and\n",
      "sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then\n",
      "shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\n",
      "      “See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\n",
      "and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock\n",
      "players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the\n",
      "Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers\n",
      "and try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that?”\n",
      "      “Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the\n",
      "goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled\n",
      "off.\n",
      "      “Very good,” said Wood.\n",
      "      “Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he\n",
      "sounded offhand.\n",
      "      “Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing\n",
      "worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And\n",
      "you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers —”\n",
      "      “— unless they crack my head open.”\n",
      "      “Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I\n",
      "mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.”\n",
      "      Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\n",
      "Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a\n",
      "large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\n",
      "      “This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball\n",
      "of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the\n",
      "Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters,\n",
      "Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because\n",
      "whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty\n",
      "points, so they nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A\n",
      "game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\n",
      "— I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so\n",
      "the players could get some sleep.\n",
      "      “Well, that’s it any questions?”\n",
      "      Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was\n",
      "doing it that was going to be the problem.\n",
      "      “We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting it\n",
      "back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few\n",
      "of these.”\n",
      "      He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\n",
      "minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as\n",
      "hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\n",
      "      Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an\n",
      "hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on.\n",
      "      “That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood\n",
      "happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn\n",
      "out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he\n",
      "hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”\n",
      " \n",
      "Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice\n",
      "three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly\n",
      "believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The\n",
      "castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were\n",
      "becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\n",
      "      On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking\n",
      "pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick\n",
      "announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,\n",
      "something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s\n",
      "toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to\n",
      "practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because\n",
      "Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with\n",
      "Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier\n",
      "about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick\n",
      "had arrived.\n",
      "      “Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!”\n",
      "squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual.\n",
      "“Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words\n",
      "properly is very important, too — never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’\n",
      "instead of ‘f’ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.”\n",
      "      It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the\n",
      "feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.\n",
      "Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it —\n",
      "Harry had to put it out with his hat.\n",
      "      Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.\n",
      "      “Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a\n",
      "windmill.\n",
      "      “You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing-gar-\n",
      "dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”\n",
      "      “You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.\n",
      "      Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,\n",
      "“Wingardium Leviosa!”\n",
      "      Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their\n",
      "heads.\n",
      "      “Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone see here,\n",
      "Miss Granger’s done it!”\n",
      "      Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\n",
      "      “It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed\n",
      "their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”\n",
      "      Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.\n",
      "Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "      “I think she heard you.”\n",
      "      “So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve noticed\n",
      "she’s got no friends.”\n",
      "      Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon.\n",
      "On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron\n",
      "overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in\n",
      "the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward\n",
      "at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween\n",
      "decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\n",
      "      A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand\n",
      "more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the\n",
      "pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at\n",
      "the start-of-term banquet.\n",
      "      Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell\n",
      "came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone\n",
      "stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table,\n",
      "and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.”\n",
      "      He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\n",
      "      There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from\n",
      "the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.\n",
      "      “Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormitories\n",
      "immediately!”\n",
      "      Percy was in his element.\n",
      "      “Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you\n",
      "follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming\n",
      "through! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!”\n",
      "      “How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\n",
      "      “Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron. “Maybe\n",
      "Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.”\n",
      "      They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.\n",
      "As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry\n",
      "suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.\n",
      "      “I’ve just thought — Hermione.”\n",
      "      “What about her?”\n",
      "      “She doesn’t know about the troll.”\n",
      "      Ron bit his lip.\n",
      "      “Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not see us.”\n",
      "      Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped\n",
      "down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They\n",
      "had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\n",
      "      “Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\n",
      "      Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the\n",
      "corridor and disappeared from view.\n",
      "      “What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in the\n",
      "dungeons with the rest of the teachers?”\n",
      "      “Search me.”\n",
      "      Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape’s\n",
      "fading footsteps.\n",
      "      “He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\n",
      "      “Can you smell something?”\n",
      "      Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old\n",
      "socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\n",
      "      And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of\n",
      "gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge\n",
      "was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it\n",
      "emerged into a patch of moonlight.\n",
      "      It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray,\n",
      "its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a\n",
      "coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell\n",
      "coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which\n",
      "dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\n",
      "      The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long\n",
      "ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\n",
      "      “The keys in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.”\n",
      "      “Good idea,” said Ron nervously.\n",
      "      They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn’t\n",
      "about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key,\n",
      "slam the door, and lock it.\n",
      "      “Yes!”\n",
      "      Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as\n",
      "they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a\n",
      "high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they’d just\n",
      "chained up.\n",
      "      “Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\n",
      "      “It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.\n",
      "      “Hermione!” they said together.\n",
      "      It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?\n",
      "Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in\n",
      "their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\n",
      "      Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if\n",
      "she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the\n",

      "onto one of their brooms, but it was no good – every time they got near him, the\n",

      "one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He\n",

      "      Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell\n",
      "him. Harry decided on the truth.\n",
      "      “I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried to get past\n",

      "      “I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of\n",
      "Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is —\n",
      "they’re really rare, and really valuable.”\n",
      "      “What is it?”\n",
      "      Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the\n",
      "touch, like water woven into material.\n",
      "      “It’s an invisibility cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face. “I’m sure\n",
      "it is — try it on.”\n",
      "      Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\n",
      "      “It is! Look down!”\n",
      "      Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the\n",
      "mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended\n",
      "in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and\n",
      "his reflection vanished completely.\n",
      "      “There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of it!”\n",
      "      Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy\n",
      "writing he had never seen before were the following words:\n",
      " \n",
      "Your father left this in my possession before he died.\n",
      "It is time it was returned to you.\n",
      "Use it well.\n",
      "A Very Merry Christmas to you.\n",
      " \n",
      "There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the\n",
      "cloak.\n",
      "      “I’d give anything for one of these,” he said. “Anything. What’s the\n",
      "matter?”\n",
      "      “Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had\n",
      "it really once belonged to his father?\n",
      "      Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung\n",
      "open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly\n",
      "out of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\n",
      "      “Merry Christmas!”\n",
      "      “Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”\n",
      "      Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F\n",
      "on it, the other a G.\n",
      "      “Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up Harry’s\n",
      "sweater. “She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.”\n",
      "      “Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded. “Come on,\n",
      "get it on, they’re lovely and warm.”\n",
      "      “I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\n",
      "      “You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed. “I suppose she\n",
      "thinks you don’t forget your name. But we’re not stupid — we know we’re\n",
      "called Gred and Forge.”\n",
      "      “What’s all this noise?”\n",
      "      Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He\n",
      "had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a\n",
      "lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\n",
      "      “P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing ours, even\n",
      "Harry got one.”\n",
      "      “I — don’t —  want —” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the\n",
      "sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\n",
      "      “And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, either,” said George.\n",
      "“Christmas is a time for family.”\n",
      "      They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by\n",
      "his sweater.\n",
      " \n",
      "Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat,\n",
      "roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas;\n",
      "tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce –\n",
      "and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic\n",
      "party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually\n",
      "bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry\n",
      "pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang, it went off with a blast\n",
      "like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the\n",
      "inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High\n",
      "Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet,\n",
      "and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\n",
      "      Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his\n",
      "teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting\n",
      "redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing\n",
      "Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and\n",
      "blushed, her top hat lopsided.\n",
      "      When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of\n",
      "things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous\n",
      "balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The\n",
      "white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to\n",
      "end up as Mrs. Norris’s Christmas dinner.\n",
      "      Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious\n",
      "snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they\n",
      "returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his\n",
      "new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have\n",
      "lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much.\n",
      "      After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,\n",
      "everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch\n",
      "Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they’d stolen his\n",
      "prefect badge.\n",
      "      It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been\n",
      "nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he\n",
      "free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.\n",
      "      Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,\n",
      "fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry\n",
      "leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\n",
      "      His father’s…this had been his father’s. He let the material flow over his\n",
      "hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\n",
      "      He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak\n",
      "around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.\n",
      "It was a very funny feeling.\n",
      "      Use it well.\n",
      "      Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to\n",
      "him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark\n",
      "and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never\n",
      "know.\n",
      "      Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him\n",
      "back — his father’s cloak — he felt that this time — the first time — he wanted\n",
      "to use it alone.\n",
      "      He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,\n",
      "and climbed through the portrait hole.\n",
      "      “Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked\n",
      "quickly down the corridor.\n",
      "      Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then\n",
      "it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He’d be able to read as long\n",
      "as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the\n",
      "invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.\n",
      "      The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his\n",
      "way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in\n",
      "midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave\n",
      "him the creeps.\n",
      "      The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping\n",
      "carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he\n",
      "held up his lamp to read the titles.\n",
      "      They didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\n",
      "words in languages Harry couldn’t understand. Some had no title at all. One\n",
      "book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back\n",
      "of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought\n",
      "a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone\n",
      "was there who shouldn’t be.\n",
      "      He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,\n",
      "he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black\n",
      "and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was\n",
      "very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\n",
      "      A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was\n",
      "screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high,\n",
      "unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp,\n",
      "which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor\n",
      "outside — stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed\n",
      "Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and\n",
      "Harry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the\n",
      "book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears.\n",
      "      He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so\n",
      "busy getting away from the library, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was\n",
      "going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t recognize where he was at all.\n",
      "There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors\n",
      "above there.\n",
      "      “You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was\n",
      "wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library Restricted\n",
      "Section.”\n",
      "      Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must\n",
      "know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his\n",
      "horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well, they can’t be\n",
      "far, we’ll catch them.”\n",
      "      Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner\n",
      "ahead. They couldn’t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they\n",
      "came much nearer they’d knock right into him — the cloak didn’t stop him from\n",
      "being solid.\n",
      "      He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It\n",
      "was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to\n",
      "move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their\n",
      "noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall,\n",
      "breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close,\n",
      "very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he\n",
      "had hidden in.\n",
      "      It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs\n",
      "were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket – but\n",
      "propped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it\n",
      "belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep\n",
      "it out of the way.\n",
      "      It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold\n",
      "frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the\n",
      "top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there\n",
      "was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to\n",
      "look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\n",
      "      He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He\n",
      "whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book\n",
      "had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole\n",
      "crowd of people standing right behind him.\n",
      "      But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to\n",
      "the mirror.\n",
      "      There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,\n",
      "reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder —\n",
      "but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a\n",
      "room full of invisible people and this mirror’s trick was that it reflected them,\n",
      "invisible or not?\n",
      "      He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his\n",
      "reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air\n",
      "behind him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were so\n",
      "close together, but he felt only air – she and the others existed only in the mirror.\n",
      "      She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes — her\n",
      "eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright\n",
      "green — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying;\n",
      "smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing\n",
      "next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very\n",
      "untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did.\n",
      "      Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching\n",
      "that of his reflection.\n",
      "      “Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?”\n",
      "      They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces\n",
      "of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other\n",
      "noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry’s\n",
      "knobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\n",
      "      The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at\n",
      "them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall\n",
      "right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half\n",
      "joy, half terrible sadness.\n",
      "      How long he stood there, he didn’t know. The reflections did not fade\n",
      "and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.\n",
      "He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away\n",
      "from his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.\n",
      " \n",
      "“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.\n",
      "      “You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\n",
      "      “I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.\n",
      "      “And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able to\n",
      "show me your other brothers and everyone.”\n",
      "      “You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round my house\n",
      "this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not\n",
      "finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren’t you eating\n",
      "anything?”\n",
      "      Harry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them\n",
      "again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very\n",
      "important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What\n",
      "did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\n",
      "      “Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”\n",
      " \n",
      "What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror\n",
      "room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more\n",
      "slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from the library,\n",
      "wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\n",
      "      “I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.”\n",
      "      “No!” Harry hissed. I know it’s here somewhere.”\n",
      "      They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but\n",
      "saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold,\n",
      "Harry spotted the suit of armor.\n",
      "      “It’s here — just here — yes!”\n",
      "      They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his\n",
      "shoulders and ran to the mirror.\n",
      "      There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.\n",
      "      “See?” Harry whispered.\n",
      "      “I can’t see anything.”\n",
      "      “Look! Look at them all…there are loads of them.…”\n",
      "      “I can only see you.”\n",
      "      “Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.”\n",
      "      Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn’t see\n",
      "his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\n",
      "      Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\n",
      "      “Look at me!” he said.\n",
      "      “Can you see all your family standing around you?”\n",
      "      “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m head\n",

      "      “What?”\n",
      "      “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the\n",
      "house cup and the Quidditch cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too.”\n",
      "      Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at\n",
      "Harry.\n",
      "      “Do you think this mirror shows the future?”\n",
      "      “How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look —”\n",

      "      “You’re only holding the Quidditch cup, what’s interesting about that? I\n",
      "want to see my parents.”\n",
      "      “Don’t push me —”\n",
      "      A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.\n",
      "They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking.\n",
      "      “Quick!”\n",
      "      Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris\n",
      "came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same\n",
      "thing — did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and\n",
      "left.\n",
      "      “This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.\n",
      "Come on.”\n",

      "Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out\n",

      "      “You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren’t you,\n",

      "closer look at the egg. “It must’ve cost you a fortune.”\n",
      "      “Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the village havin’ a few\n",

      "Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\n",
      "      “Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as evening\n",
      "after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting.\n",
      "Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It\n",
      "was driving them nuts.\n",
      "      Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from\n",
      "Hagrid. He had written only two words: It’s hatching.\n",
      "      Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione\n",

      "      “Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon\n",
      "hatching?”\n",

      "      “Shut up!” Harry whispered.\n",
      "      Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How\n",
      "much had he heard? Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.\n",
      "      Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,\n",
      "Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning\n",
      "break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three\n",
      "of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the\n",
      "edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\n",
      "      “It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside.\n",
      "      The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something\n",
      "was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\n",
      "      They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.\n",
      "      All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby\n",
      "dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked\n",
      "like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its\n",
      "skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and\n",
      "bulging, orange eyes.\n",
      "      It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\n",
      "       “Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke\n",
      "the dragon’s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.\n",
      "      “Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid.\n",

      "      “What’s the matter?”\n",
      "      “Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains — it’s a kid —\n",

      "      Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no\n",
      "mistaking him.\n",
      "      Malfoy had seen the dragon.\n",
      " \n",
      "Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week\n",
      "made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free\n",
      "time in Hagrid’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\n",
      "      “Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.”\n",
      "      “I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.”\n",
      "      They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a\n",
      "week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn’t been doing his\n",
      "gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were\n",
      "empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\n",
      "      “I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at the dragon\n",
      "with misty eyes. “He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s\n",
      "Mommy?”\n",
      "      “He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.\n",
      "      “Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and Norbert’s going to\n",
      "be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.”\n",
      "      Hagrid bit his lip.\n",
      "      “I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump him, I can’t.”\n",
      "      Harry suddenly turned to Ron. “Charlie.” he said.\n",

      "      “No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.\n",

      "      “Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?”\n",

      "open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s invisibility cloak.\n",

      "      “I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.\n",
      "      “All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. “So me, Harry,\n",
      "an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if\n",
      "any of us finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out\n",
      "an’ practice now — that’s it — an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks,\n",
      "an’ we’ll all come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.”\n",
      "      The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in\n",
      "the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy,\n",
      "Neville, and Fang took the right.\n",
      "      They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a\n",
      "ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on\n",
      "the fallen leaves.\n",
      "      Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\n",
      "      “Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked.\n",
      "      “Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they’re\n",
      "powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.”\n",
      "      They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;\n",
      "there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn\n",
      "blood here and there along the winding path.\n",
      "      “You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ worry, it can’t’ve\n",
      "gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then we’ll be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT\n",
      "TREE!”\n",
      "      Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind\n",
      "a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it,\n",
      "ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead\n",
      "leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was\n",
      "squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\n",
      "      “I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here that shouldn’ be.”\n",
      "      “A werewolf?” Harry suggested.\n",
      "      “That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, neither,” said Hagrid\n",
      "grimly. “Right, follow me, but careful, now.”\n",
      "      They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly,\n",
      "in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\n",
      "      “Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m armed!”\n",
      "      And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a\n",
      "man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut\n",
      "body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped.\n",
      "      “Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are yeh?”\n",
      "      He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand.\n",
      "      “Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful\n",
      "voice. “Were you going to shoot me?”\n",
      "      “Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.\n",
      "“There’s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione\n",
      "Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan, you two. He’s\n",
      "a centaur.\n",
      "      “We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly.\n",
      "      “Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And do you learn\n",
      "much, up at the school?”\n",
      "      “Erm —”\n",
      "      “A bit,” said Hermione timidly.\n",
      "      “A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He flung back his head\n",
      "and stared at the sky. “Mars is bright tonight.”\n",
      "      “Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad we’ve run inter\n",
      "yeh, Ronan, ‘cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin’?”\n",
      "      Ronan didn’t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then\n",
      "sighed again.\n",
      "      “Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. “So it has been for\n",
      "ages past, so it is now.”\n",
      "      “Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’ Ronan? Anythin’\n",
      "unusual?”\n",
      "      “Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him\n",
      "impatiently. “Unusually bright.”\n",
      "      “Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home, said\n",
      "Hagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?”\n",
      "      Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, “The forest\n",
      "hides many secrets.”\n",
      "      A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,\n",
      "but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking\n",
      "than Ronan.\n",
      "      “Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?”\n",
      "      “Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?”\n",
      "      “Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you seen anythin’ odd in\n",
      "here lately? There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?”\n",
      "      Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. “Mars is\n",
      "bright tonight,” he said simply.\n",
      "      “We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of you do see\n",
      "anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be off, then.”\n",
      "      Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their\n",
      "shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\n",
      "      “Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight answer out of a\n",
      "centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.”\n",
      "      “Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione.\n",
      "      “Oh, a fair few….Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they’re\n",
      "good enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word. They’re deep, mind,\n",
      "centaurs…they know things…jus’ don’ let on much.”\n",
      "      “D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said Harry.\n",
      "      “Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what’s\n",
      "bin killin’ the unicorns – never heard anythin’ like it before.”\n",
      "      They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking\n",
      "nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched.\n",
      "He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just\n",
      "passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid’s arm.\n",
      "      “Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!”\n",
      "      “You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the path, I’ll come back\n",
      "for yeh!”\n",
      "      They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood\n",
      "looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the\n",
      "rustling of leaves around them.\n",
      "      “You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered Hermione.\n",
      "      “I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville…it’s our fault\n",
      "he’s here in the first place.”\n",
      "      The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry’s\n",
      "seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was\n",
      "going on? Where were the others?\n",
      "      At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return. Malfoy,\n",
      "Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had\n",
      "sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and\n",
      "sent up the sparks.\n",
      "      “We’ll be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket you two were\n",
      "makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me an’\n",
      "Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a\n",
      "whisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta\n",
      "get this done.”\n",
      "      So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They\n",
      "walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path\n",
      "became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry\n",
      "thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots\n",
      "of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.\n",
      "Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient\n",
      "oak.\n",
      "      “Look —” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\n",
      "      Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\n",
      "      It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen\n",
      "anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles\n",
      "where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.\n",
      "      Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him\n",
      "freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.…Then, out\n",
      "of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some\n",
      "stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure\n",
      "reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and\n",
      "began to drink its blood.\n",
      "      “AAAAAAAAAARGH!”\n",
      "      Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang. The hooded\n",
      "figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling\n",
      "down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t\n",
      "move for fear.\n",
      "      Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though\n",
      "his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves\n",
      "behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the\n",
      "figure.\n",
      "      The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute\n",
      "or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing\n",
      "over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair\n",
      "and a palomino body.\n",
      "      “Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\n",
      "      “Yes — thank you — what was that?”\n",
      "      The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale\n",
      "sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood\n",
      "out, livid, on Harry’s forehead.\n",
      "      “You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back to Hagrid.\n",
      "The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. Can you ride? It will be\n",
      "quicker this way.\n",
      "      “My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front\n",
      "legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\n",
      "      There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\n",
      "clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving\n",
      "and sweaty.\n",
      "      “Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on\n",
      "your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”\n",
      "      “Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The\n",
      "quicker he leaves this forest, the better.”\n",
      "      “What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, Firenze,\n",
      "we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is\n",
      "to come in the movements of the planets?”\n",
      "      Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he was\n",
      "acting for the best, “ he said in his gloomy voice.\n",
      "      Bane kicked his back legs in anger.\n",
      "      “For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with\n",
      "what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after\n",
      "stray humans in our forest!”\n",
      "      Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to\n",
      "grab his shoulders to stay on.\n",
      "      “Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not\n",
      "understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I\n",
      "set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans\n",
      "alongside me if I must.”\n",
      "      And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,\n",
      "they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\n",
      "      Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on.\n",
      "      “Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you saved me\n",
      "from, anyway?”\n",
      "      Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case\n",
      "of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question. They made their\n",
      "way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t\n",
      "want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense\n",
      "patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\n",
      "      “Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”\n",
      "      “No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve only used the horn\n",
      "and tail hair in Potions.”\n",
      "      “That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said Firenze.\n",
      "“Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a\n",
      "crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from\n",
      "death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to\n",
      "save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment\n",
      "the blood touches your lips.”\n",
      "      Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in\n",
      "the moonlight.\n",
      "      “But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to\n",
      "be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”\n",
      "      “It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long enough\n",
      "to drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength\n",
      "and power — something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you\n",
      "know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?”\n",
      "      “The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t\n",
      "understand who —”\n",
      "      “Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,\n",
      "who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?”\n",
      "      It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart.\n",
      "Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told\n",
      "him on the night they had met: “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion.\n",
      "Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”\n",
      "      “Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol-”\n",
      "      “Harry! Harry, are you all right?”\n",
      "      Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along\n",
      "behind her.\n",
      "      “I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The\n",
      "unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”\n",
      "      “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to\n",
      "examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”\n",
      "      Harry slid off his back.\n",
      "      “Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read\n",
      "wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\n",
      "      He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry\n",
      "shivering behind him.\n",
      " \n",
      "Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.\n",
      "He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him\n",
      "awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell\n",
      "him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\n",
      "      Harry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He\n",

      "sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him\n",

      "      “Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy\n",
      "slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a\n",
      "stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many\n",
      "people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they\n",
      "found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?”\n",
      "      “What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the\n",

      "      Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and\n",
      "sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\n",
      "      “Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?”\n",
      "      “Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\n",

      "look like?”\n",
      "      “Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.”\n",
      "      He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\n",

      "      “We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger\n",
      "how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak —\n",
      "it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore\n",
      "believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s\n",
      "Dumbledore’s office?”\n",
      "      They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right\n",

      "      It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\n",

      "Harry and Ron thought.\n",
      "      “See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though\n",
      "this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?”\n",
      "      Harry swallowed — now what?\n",
      "      “It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because\n",
      "Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.\n",
      "      “Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He\n",
      "received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at\n",
      "once.”\n",
      "      “He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?”\n",
      "      “Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many\n",

      "about the Sorcerer’s Stone —”\n",
      "      Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. The books\n",
      "she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up.\n",
      "      “How do you know —?” she spluttered.\n",
      "      “Professor, I think — I know — that Sn— that someone’s going to try\n",
      "and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.”\n",
      "      She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\n",
      "      “Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. I don’t\n",

      "      “But Professor —”\n",
      "      “Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She bent down\n",

      "out of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out\n",
      "everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that\n",

      "up.”\n",
      "      “But what can we —”\n",
      "      Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\n",

      "      “Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.\n",
      "      They stared at him.\n",
      "      “You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "      “We were —” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\n",
      "      “You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this,\n",
      "people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to\n",
      "lose any more points, can it?”\n",
      "      Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\n",
      "      “Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will\n",
      "personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.”\n",
      "      He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\n",
      "      Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\n",
      "      “Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us\n",
      "has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staff room and follow him if\n",
      "he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.”\n",
      "      “Why me?”\n",
      "      “It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor\n",
      "Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so\n",
      "worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong….’”\n",
      "      “Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for\n",
      "Snape.\n",
      "      “And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron.\n",
      "“Come on.”\n",
      "      But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the\n",
      "door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall\n",
      "turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\n",
      "      “I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of\n",
      "enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you’ve come\n",
      "anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes,\n",
      "Weasley, from my own house!”\n",
      "      Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At\n",

      "and Hermione came in.\n",
      "      “I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I\n",
      "was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and\n",
      "I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”\n",
      "      “Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said.\n",
      "      The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\n",

      "      “SO WHAT” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold\n",

      "when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled\n",
      "from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points\n",
      "doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your\n",
      "families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get\n",

      "going over to the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing\n",
      "you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”\n",
      "      He glared at them.\n",
      "      “You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.\n",
      "      “I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.”\n",
      "      “But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.\n",
      "      “All — all three of us?”\n",
      "      “Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?”\n",
      "      “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to\n",
      "the Stone without us? I’d better go and took through my books, there might be\n",
      "something useful….”\n",
      "      “But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”\n",
      "      “Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in secret\n",
      "that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me\n",
      "out after that.”\n",
      " \n",
      "After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.\n",
      "Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry\n",
      "any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione\n",
      "was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the\n",
      "enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much.\n",
      "Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\n",
      "      Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\n",
      "      “Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,\n",
      "stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out\n",
      "the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas.\n",
      "He pocketed it to use on Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing.\n",
      "      He ran back down to the common room.\n",
      "      “We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us\n",
      "– if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own —”\n",
      "      “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville\n",
      "appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as\n",
      "though he’d been making another bid for freedom.\n",
      "      “Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak\n",
      "behind his back.\n",
      "      Neville stared at their guilty faces.\n",
      "      “You’re going out again,” he said.\n",
      "      “No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t you go to bed,\n",
      "Neville?”\n",
      "      Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn’t afford\n",
      "to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\n",
      "      “You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. Gryffindor will\n",
      "be in even more trouble.”\n",
      "      “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.”\n",
      "      But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\n",

      "—”\n",
      "      “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. I don’t think you should be\n",
      "breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to\n",
      "people!”\n",
      "      “Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville, you don’t know\n",
      "what you’re doing.”\n",
      "      He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt\n",
      "out of sight.\n",
      "      “Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I’m ready!”\n",
      "      Harry turned to Hermione.\n",
      "      “Do something,” he said desperately.\n",
      "      Hermione stepped forward.\n",
      "      “Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.”\n",

      "      “Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville.\n",
      "      Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole\n",
      "body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a\n",
      "board.\n",
      "      Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed together so\n",
      "he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\n",
      "      “What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.\n",
      "      “It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh, Neville, I’m so\n",
      "sorry.”\n",
      "      “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.\n",
      "      “You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over him and\n",
      "pulled on the invisibility cloak.\n",
      "      But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very\n",
      "good omen. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every\n",
      "distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot\n",
      "of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.\n",
      "      “Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but\n",
      "Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned\n",
      "her lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything.\n",
      "      They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the\n",
      "third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people\n",
      "would trip.\n",
      "      “Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He\n",
      "narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you.\n",
      "Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”\n",
      "      He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\n",
      "      “Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.”\n",
      "      Harry had a sudden idea.\n",
      "      “Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his own\n",
      "reasons for being invisible.”\n",
      "      Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and\n",
      "hovered about a foot off the stairs.\n",
      "      “So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,” he said greasily. “My\n",
      "mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re invisible —\n",
      "forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.”\n",
      "      “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away from this\n",
      "place tonight.”\n",
      "      “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again.\n",
      "“Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.”\n",
      "      And he scooted off.\n",
      "      “Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.\n",
      "      A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor —\n",
      "and the door was already ajar.\n",
      "      “Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past\n",
      "Fluffy.”\n",
      "      Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them\n",
      "what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\n",
      "      “If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the\n",
      "cloak, I won’t need it now.”\n",
      "      “Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.\n",
      "      “We’re coming,” said Hermione.\n",
      "      Harry pushed the door open.\n",
      "      As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the\n",
      "dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them.\n",
      "      “What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.\n",
      "      “Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”\n",
      "      “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well, here\n",
      "goes ….”\n",
      "      He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but\n",
      "from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath.\n",
      "Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees,\n",
      "then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\n",
      "      “Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and\n",
      "crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they\n",
      "approached the giant heads. “I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said\n",
      "Ron, peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”\n",
      "      “No, I don’t!”\n",
      "      “All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s\n",
      "legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.\n",
      "      “What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.\n",
      "      “Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just\n",
      "have to drop.”\n",
      "      Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention\n",
      "and pointed at himself.\n",
      "      “You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep\n",
      "this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”\n",
      "      Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled\n",
      "and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep\n",
      "sleep.\n",
      "      Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was\n",
      "no sign of the bottom.\n",
      "      He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\n",
      "fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t\n",
      "follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?”\n",
      "      “Right,” said Ron.\n",
      "      “See you in a minute, I hope …”\n",
      "      And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,\n",
      "down and —\n",
      "      FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something\n",
      "soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though\n",
      "he was sitting on some sort of plant.\n",
      "      “It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which\n",
      "was the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”\n",
      "      Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\n",
      "      “What’s this stuff?” were his first words.\n",
      "      “Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall.\n",
      "Come on, Hermione!”\n",
      "      The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\n",
      "Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.\n",
      "      “We must be miles under the school,” she said.\n",
      "      “Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.\n",
      "      “Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”\n",
      "      She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\n",
      "because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike\n",
      "tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been\n",
      "bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\n",
      "      Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\n",
      "her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them,\n",
      "but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound\n",
      "around them.\n",
      "      “Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s\n",
      "Devil’s Snare!”\n",
      "      “Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled\n",
      "Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. “Shut\n",
      "up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione.\n",
      "      “Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it\n",
      "curled around his chest.\n",
      "      “Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare…what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes\n",
      "the dark and the damp.”\n",
      "      “So light a fire!” Harry choked.\n",
      "      “Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "      “HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR\n",
      "NOT?”\n",
      "      “Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,\n",
      "muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on\n",
      "Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip\n",
      "as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it\n",
      "unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\n",
      "      “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he\n",
      "joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\n",
      "      “Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis —\n",
      "‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”\n",
      "      “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was\n",
      "the only way forward.\n",
      "      All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water\n",
      "trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was\n",
      "reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the\n",
      "dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a\n",
      "fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough….\n",
      "      “Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.\n",
      "      Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up\n",
      "ahead.\n",
      "      “Do you think it’s a ghost?”\n",
      "      “I don’t know…sounds like wings to me.”\n",
      "      “There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”\n",
      "      They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a\n",
      "brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small,\n",
      "jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite\n",
      "side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\n",
      "      “Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.\n",
      "      “Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if\n",
      "they all swooped down at once…well, there’s no other choice…I’ll run.”\n",
      "      He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\n",
      "across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any\n",
      "second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the\n",
      "handle, but it was locked.\n",
      "      The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it\n",
      "wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\n",
      "      “Now what?” said Ron.\n",
      "      “These birds…they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione.\n",
      "      They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering?\n",
      "      “They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re keys! Winged keys\n",
      "— look carefully. So that must mean…” he looked around the chamber while the\n",
      "other two squinted up at the flock of keys. “…yes — look! Broomsticks! We’ve\n",
      "got to catch the key to the door!”\n",
      "      “But there are hundreds of them!”\n",
      "      Ron examined the lock on the door.\n",
      "      “We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, like the\n",
      "handle.”\n",
      "      They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into\n",
      "the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched\n",
      "keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\n",
      "      Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He\n",
      "had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving\n",
      "about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that\n",
      "had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the\n",
      "keyhole.\n",
      "      “That one!” he called to the others. “That big one — there — no, there\n",
      "— with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.”\n",
      "      Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into\n",
      "the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n",
      "      “We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key\n",
      "with the damaged wing. “Ron, you come at it from above — Hermione, stay\n",
      "below and stop it from going down and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!”\n",
      "      Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and\n",
      "Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a\n",
      "nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and\n",
      "Hermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\n",
      "      They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his\n",
      "hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned – it worked. The moment the lock\n",
      "had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had\n",
      "been caught twice.\n",
      "      “Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They\n",
      "nodded. He pulled the door open.\n",
      "      The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But as\n",
      "they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "      They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black\n",
      "chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like\n",
      "black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry,\n",
      "Ron and Hermione shivered slightly – the towering white chessmen had no\n",
      "faces.\n",
      "      “Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.\n",
      "      “It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across the\n",
      "room.”\n",
      "      Behind the white pieces they could see another door.\n",
      "      “How?” said Hermione nervously.\n",
      "      “I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.”\n",
      "      He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight’s\n",
      "horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the\n",
      "knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n",
      "      “Do we — er — have to join you to get across?” The black knight\n",
      "nodded. Ron turned to the other two.\n",
      "      “This needs thinking about…” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take the\n",
      "place of three of the black pieces….”\n",
      "      Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\n",
      "“Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess\n",
      "—”\n",
      "      “We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.”\n",
      "      “Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next\n",
      "to him instead of that castle.”\n",
      "      “What about you?”\n",
      "      “I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.\n",
      "      The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\n",
      "knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked\n",
      "off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.\n",
      "      “White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the board.\n",
      "“Yes…look…”\n",
      "      A white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n",
      "      Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he\n",
      "sent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they lost?\n",
      "      “Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.”\n",
      "      Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white\n",
      "queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay\n",
      "quite still, facedown.\n",
      "      “Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to\n",
      "take that bishop, Hermione, go on.”\n",
      "      Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.\n",
      "Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice,\n",
      "Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He\n",
      "himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had\n",
      "lost black ones.\n",
      "      “We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think — let me\n",
      "think…”\n",
      "      The white queen turned her blank face toward him.\n",
      "      “Yes…” said Ron softly, “It’s the only way…I’ve got to be taken.”\n",
      "      “NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.\n",
      "      “That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices! I\n",
      "take one step forward and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate\n",
      "the king, Harry!”\n",
      "      “But —”\n",
      "      “Do you want to stop Snape or not?”\n",
      "      “Ron —”\n",
      "      “Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”\n",
      "      There was no alternative.\n",
      "      “Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go — now,\n",
      "don’t hang around once you’ve won.”\n",
      "      He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard\n",
      "across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione\n",
      "screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side.\n",
      "He looked as if he’d been knocked out.\n",
      "      Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\n",
      "      The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had\n",
      "won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one\n",
      "last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door\n",
      "and up the next passageway.\n",
      "      “What if he’s —?”\n",
      "      “He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you\n",
      "reckon’s next?”\n",
      "      “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put\n",
      "charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive;\n",
      "that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.”\n",
      "      They had reached another door.\n",
      "      “All right?” Harry whispered.\n",
      "      “Go on.”\n",
      "      Harry pushed it open.\n",
      "      A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their\n",
      "robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of\n",
      "them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody\n",
      "lump on its head.\n",
      "      “I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they\n",
      "stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”\n",
      "      He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what\n",
      "came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with\n",
      "seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\n",
      "      “Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”\n",
      "      They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind\n",
      "them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same\n",
      "instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\n",
      "      “Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry\n",
      "looked over her shoulder to read it:\n",
      " \n",
      "Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\n",
      "Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,\n",
      "One among us seven will let you move ahead,\n",
      "Another will transport the drinker back instead,\n",
      "Two among our number hold only nettle wine,\n",
      "Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\n",
      "Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\n",
      "To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\n",
      "First, however slyly the poison tries to hide\n",
      "You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side;\n",
      "Second, different are those who stand at either end,\n",
      "But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\n",
      "Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,\n",
      "Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\n",
      "Fourth, the second left and the second on the right\n",
      "Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\n",
      " \n",
      "Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling,\n",
      "the very last thing he felt like doing.\n",
      "      “Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s logic — a puzzle. A\n",
      "lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here\n",
      "forever.”\n",
      "      “But so will we, won’t we?”\n",
      "       “Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on this\n",
      "paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely\n",
      "through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.”\n",
      "      “But how do we know which to drink?”\n",
      "      “Give me a minute.”\n",
      "      Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down\n",
      "the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped\n",
      "her hands.\n",
      "      “Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the black\n",
      "fire — toward the Stone.”\n",
      "      Harry looked at the tiny bottle.\n",
      "      “There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly one\n",
      "swallow.”\n",
      "      They looked at each other.\n",
      "      “Which one will get you back through the purple flames?”\n",
      "      Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\n",
      "      “You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab\n",
      "brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past\n",
      "Fluffy — go straight to  the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need\n",
      "him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him,\n",
      "really.”\n",
      "      “But Harry — what if You-Know-Who’s with him?”\n",
      "      “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at his scar. “I\n",
      "might get lucky again.”\n",
      "      Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her\n",
      "arms around him.\n",
      "      “Hermione!”\n",
      "      “Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.”\n",
      "      “I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of\n",
      "him.\n",
      "      “Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more\n",
      "important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful!”\n",
      "      “You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is which, aren’t you?”\n",
      "      “Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at\n",
      "the end, and shuddered.\n",
      "      “It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.\n",
      "      “No — but it’s like ice.”\n",

      "      “Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here,\n",
      "Potter.”\n",
      "      “But I thought — Snape —”\n",
      "      “Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual quivering treble,\n",
      "either, but cold and sharp. “Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So\n",
      "useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who\n",
      "would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?”\n",
      "      Harry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it couldn’t.\n",
      "      “But Snape tried to kill me!”\n",
      "      “No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally\n",
      "knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She\n",
      "broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I’d have got you off\n",
      "that broom. I’d have managed it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a\n",
      "countercurse, trying to save you.”\n",
      "      “Snape was trying to save me?”\n",
      "      “Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think he wanted to\n",
      "referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn’t do it again. Funny,\n",
      "really…he needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with Dumbledore\n",
      "watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor\n",
      "from winning, he did make himself unpopular…and what a waste of time, when\n",
      "after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.”\n",
      "      Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped\n",
      "themselves tightly around Harry.\n",
      "      “You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on\n",
      "Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was\n",
      "guarding the Stone.”\n",
      "      “You let the troll in?”\n",
      "      “Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I\n",
      "did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else\n",
      "was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went\n",
      "straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat\n",
      "you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s leg off\n",
      "properly.\n",
      "      “Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”\n",
      "      It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It\n",
      "was the Mirror of Erised.\n",
      "      “This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping\n",
      "his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like\n",
      "this…but he’s in London…I’ll be far away by the time he gets back…”\n",
      "      All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him\n",
      "from concentrating on the mirror.\n",
      "      “I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.\n",
      "      “Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.\n",
      "“He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected\n",
      "me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I had Lord\n",
      "Voldemort on my side….”\n",
      "      Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\n",
      "      “I see the Stone…I’m presenting it to my master…but where is it?”\n",
      "      Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give. He\n",
      "had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\n",
      "      “But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.”\n",
      "      “Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts\n",
      "with your father, didn’t you know? They loathed each other. But he never\n",
      "wanted you dead.”\n",
      "      “But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape was\n",
      "threatening you.…”\n",
      "      For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face.\n",
      "      “Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master’s instructions\n",
      "— he is a great wizard and I am weak —”\n",
      "      “You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Harry gasped.\n",
      "      “He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I met him when I\n",
      "traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous\n",
      "ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There\n",
      "is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it…Since\n",
      "then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He\n",
      "has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive\n",
      "mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most\n",
      "displeased. He punished me…decided he would have to keep a closer watch on\n",
      "me.…”\n",
      "      Quirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon\n",
      "Alley — how could he have been so stupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very\n",
      "day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\n",
      "      Quirrell cursed under his breath.\n",
      "      “I don’t understand…is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?”\n",
      "      Harry’s mind was racing.\n",
      "      What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he\n",
      "thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I\n",
      "should see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden! But how\n",
      "can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?\n",
      "      He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell\n",
      "noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over.\n",
      "Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\n",
      "      “What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”\n",
      "      And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come\n",
      "from Quirrell himself.\n",
      "      “Use the boy…Use the boy.…”\n",
      "      Quirrell rounded on Harry.\n",
      "      “Yes — Potter — come here.”\n",
      "      He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry\n",
      "got slowly to his feet.\n",
      "      “Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me what\n",
      "you see.”\n",
      "      Harry walked toward him.\n",
      "      I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see,\n",
      "that’s all.\n",
      "      Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that\n",
      "seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of\n",
      "the mirror, and opened them again.\n",
      "      He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment\n",
      "later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a\n",
      "blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did\n",
      "so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly\n",
      "— he’d gotten the Stone.\n",
      "      “Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?”\n",
      "      Harry screwed up his courage.\n",
      "      “I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he invented. “I — I’ve\n",
      "won the house cup for Gryffindor.”\n",
      "      Quirrell cursed again.\n",
      "      “Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the\n",
      "Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\n",
      "      But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though\n",
      "Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips.\n",
      "      “He lies…He lies.…”\n",
      "      “Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me the truth! What did\n",
      "you just see?”\n",
      "      The high voice spoke again.\n",
      "      “Let me speak to him…face-to-face…”\n",
      "      “Master, you are not strong enough!”\n",
      "      “I have strength enough…for this…”\n",
      "      Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn’t\n",
      "move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to\n",
      "unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell’s head\n",
      "looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\n",
      "      Harry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound. Where there\n",
      "should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible\n",
      "face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for\n",
      "nostrils, like a snake.\n",
      "      “Harry Potter…” it whispered.\n",
      "      Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move.\n",
      "      “See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere shadow and vapor….I\n",
      "have form only when I can share another’s body…but there have always been\n",
      "those willing to let me into their hearts and minds…Unicorn blood has\n",
      "strengthened me, these past weeks…you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me\n",
      "in the forest…and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body\n",
      "of my own….Now…why don’t you give me that Stone in your pocket?”\n",
      "      So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry’s legs. He\n",
      "stumbled backward.\n",
      "      “Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your own life and join\n",
      "me…or you’ll meet the same end as your parents…They died begging me for\n",
      "mercy…”\n",
      "      “LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly.\n",
      "      Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see\n",
      "him. The evil face was now smiling.\n",
      "      “How touching…” it hissed. “I always value bravery….Yes, boy, your\n",
      "parents were brave…I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous\n",
      "fight…but your mother needn’t have died…she was trying to protect you…Now\n",
      "give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.”\n",
      "      “NEVER!”\n",
      "      Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed “SEIZE\n",
      "HIM!” and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist. At\n",
      "once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; his head felt as though it\n",
      "was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his\n",
      "surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened — he looked\n",
      "around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain,\n",
      "looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes.\n",
      "      “Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell\n",
      "lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands\n",
      "around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he\n",
      "could see Quirrell howling in agony.\n",
      "      “Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!”\n",
      "      And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go\n",
      "of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they\n",
      "looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\n",
      "      “Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Voldemort.\n",
      "      Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct,\n",
      "reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face —\n",
      "      “AAAARGH!”\n",
      "      Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:\n",
      "Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his\n",
      "only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him\n",
      "from doing a curse.\n",
      "      Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight\n",
      "as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in\n",
      "Harry’s head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only hear Quirrell’s\n",
      "terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other\n",
      "voices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”\n",
      "      He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and\n",
      "fell into blackness, down…down… down….\n",
      " \n",
      "Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it,\n",
      "but his arms were too heavy.\n",
      "      He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How\n",
      "strange.\n",
      "      He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into\n",
      "view above him.\n",
      "      “Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.\n",
      "      Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It was\n",
      "Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —”\n",
      "      “Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said\n",
      "Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.”\n",
      "      “Then who does? Sir, I —”\n",
      "      “Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.”\n",
      "      Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the\n",
      "hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him\n",
      "was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\n",
      "      “Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, beaming.\n",
      "“What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\n",
      "complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends\n",
      "Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet\n",
      "seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt\n",
      "it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.”\n",
      "      “How long have I been in here?”\n",
      "      “Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most\n",
      "relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.”\n",

      "      “I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor\n",
      "Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that,\n",
      "although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.”\n",
      "      “You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?”\n",
      "      “We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than\n",
      "it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I\n",
      "arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.”\n",
      "      “It was you.”\n",
      "      “I feared I might be too late.”\n",
      "      “You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the Stone much longer –”\n",
      "      “Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed you. For one\n",
      "terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been\n",
      "destroyed.”\n",
      "      “Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — Nicolas Flamel —”\n",
      "      “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite\n",
      "delighted. “You did do the thing properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have\n",
      "had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.”\n",
      "      “But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?”\n",
      "      “They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes,\n",
      "they will die.”\n",
      "      Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.\n",
      "      “To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and\n",
      "Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the\n",
      "well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone\n",
      "was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could\n",
      "want! The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble\n",
      "is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "      Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled\n",
      "at the ceiling.\n",
      "      “Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking…sir — even if the Stone’s gone,\n",
      "Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —”\n",
      "      “Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear\n",

      "he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?”\n",
      "      “No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\n",
      "for another body to share…not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left\n",
      "Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it\n",
      "will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing\n",
      "battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never\n",
      "return to power.”\n",
      "      Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then\n",

      "deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some\n",
      "protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and\n",

      "covered the wall behind the High Table.\n",
      "      When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody\n",

      "       “Third — to Mr. Harry Potter…” said Dumbledore. The room went\n",
      "deadly quiet. “…for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor\n",
      "house sixty points.”\n",
      "      The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling\n",
      "themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two\n",
      "points — exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup — if\n",

       "\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J. K. Rowling is published by Simon & Schuster. The book is about a young boy who discovers the truth about his family's past. Mr. Dursley saw a tabby cat reading a map on the corner of Privet Drive. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. Mr. Dursley thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon. When he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. Mr. Dursley saw the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal catbehavior?  Mr.  Durley wondered. Mr. and Mrs. Dursley were watching the news when they heard the name “Potter’s” on the news. “I just thought…maybe…it was something to do with…you know…her crowd,” said Mr. Durley. The cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. The man was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak, and high-heeled boots. Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore sat together in the Dursleys’ living-room window. “Even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. ” “You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years. ’ “We have much to be thankful for,’ said Dumbledore. � “Would you care for a lemon drop? ” Professor McGonagall had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day. She was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Professor McGonagall asked Dumbledore why he was taking Harry to live with his aunt and uncle. “It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly, “His aunt anduncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’m older. ” “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him!  He’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future’ Professor Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall met a huge man on a motorcycle. The man was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. To order a copy of the book for £12.99, visit the publisher’s website. Harry Potter woke up to the sound of his aunt Petunia's shrill voice. He tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before. Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He wore round glasses held together with Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley hadpunched him on the nose. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together. Dudley's parents took him and a friend out for the day every year on his birthday. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there. Dudley and his best friend Piers Polkiss were taken to the zoo for the first time in their lives. Harry was left in the car with his aunt and uncle. Uncle Vernon had warned him not to get involved. Harry and the Dursleys were on their way home from school when a motorcycle overtook them on the road. “I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly  “It was flying. ” “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY! ” said Uncle Vernon. Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Harry was in the reptile house when a boa constrictor opened its eyes and winked at him. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come. … Thanksss, amigo’ Harry had lived with the Dursleys for as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. The book is available in hardback, paperback and audiobook. Aunt Petunia is dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. Harry looked in the bowl again. “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet,” he said. Uncle Vernon said it was the proudest moment of his life. Harry Potter received a letter addressed to him from Mr. H. Potter. The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. “Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia, “Ate a funny whelk. …” Harry and Dudley had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole. Uncle Vernon did something he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. “I’m not having one in the house, Petunia!” yelled Uncle Vernon. The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), and one where Dudley slept. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0owned from the cupboard to this room. Nearly everything in here was broken. Harry's first letter from the Dursleys arrived on Friday. The letters had been pushed under the door, slotted through the mail slot and even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slots. Twenty-four letters to Harry \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the twodozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed them. Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to. “Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly? ” Dudley asked Harry in grotesqueamazement. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and musty sheets. They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. Uncle Vernon drove them into the middle of a forest, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car and off they went again. The Dursleys are stranded in a broken-down house in the middle of a storm. Uncle Vernon offers them a boat to get them out of the storm. The house smells strongly of seaweed and the fireplace is damp and empty. Harry Potter and theorcerer's Stone is published by Hodder & Stoughton at £16.99. The book is available in hardback, paperback and audiobook. The giant reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, and threw it into a corner of the room. “Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant, “Yeh look a \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom's eyes. ” “I demand that you leave at once, sir! ” said Uncle Vernon. The giant handed Harry six sausages and said, “Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley. ” The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Call me Hagrid,” he said,  “everyone does.  An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.” Harry Potter received a letter in the mail from Hogwarts. The letter was addressed to Mr. H. Potter. Harry was shocked to learn that he was a wizard. He asked his uncle, Vernon Dursley, about the letter. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. To order a copy of the book for £12.99, call the MailOnline Bookshop on 08457 909090. Hagrid told Harry about a wizard who went ‘worse than worse’ Harry asked: “Who? ” Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. “It’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows —” “Well — I don�’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does. ” Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1, is out now on BBC1. It is the first part of a two-part series about Harry’s life in Hogwarts. Uncle Vernon snarled at Harry: “I accept there’s something bizarre about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured” Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, ‘I’m warning you, Dursley — I’re warning you — one more word…. ’ Uncle Vernon’S courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and flattened himself. Harry Potter had spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. If he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? “Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. ” To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. “Never made things happen when you was scared orangry? ” “Harry Potter, not a wizard — Harry Potter and theorcerer's Stone is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. The book is available in hardback, paperback and e-book. Hagrid was asleep on the collapsed sofa when an owl rapped its claw on the window. Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. Hagrid took Harry on a trip to Gringotts, the Wizards’ bank. The bank was run by goblins. Harry asked Hagrid: “Why would you be mad to try and rob it? ” Harry and Hagrid were on their way to the train station. Hagrid was knitting a canary-yellow circus tent. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone.  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is located in London. First-year students will need three sets of work robes, one pair of protective gloves, and a cauldron. Hagrid steered Harry into the Leaky Cauldron. The place was very dark and shabby. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him. Professor Quirrell shook Harry’s hand and led him through a small, walled courtyard. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. Hagrid and Harry were walking through a street of shops. The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. “Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first. ” Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. Hagrid and Harry followed a goblin down a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. They were in an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. Harry asked, “What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen? ” “Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret.  Hogwarts business. ” Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. “Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron?  I hate them Gringotts carts. ” “No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. Harry and the drawling boy went to buy parchment and quills. Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams. Hagrid tells Harry about Quidditch, the Wizard sport. Harry asks about You-Know-Who. Hagrid says he was trying to find out how to curse Dudley. Curses andCountercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with theLatest Revenges) Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potioningredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell. While Hagrid asked the manbehind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients, Harry examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each. An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0moons through the gloom of the shop. “I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly, “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands…” ‘No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same.’ ‘You will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand. ’ Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road. He chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. “Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. Harry Potter and theorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervouslynervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. “Would it be all right if you gave me a lift? ” he asked his aunt and uncle. Harry had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it. He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. A group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it. But just as the boy \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0came swarming in front of him. “Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.  “Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?  Can’t you tell I’m George? ” Harry Potter made his way through the crowd to the Hogwarts Express. The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. Harry was on the train to Hogwarts when he heard his parents talking. His mother was rubbing Ron's nose, and his father was talking to Percy the Prefect. The twins were talking about how they had blown up a toilet. Harry Potter and his friends were on their way to Hogwarts when they met You-Know-Who. They asked their mother to let them go on the train with him, but she turned them away. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their sister running to keep up with the train. Harry Potter and Ron Weasley sat in the same compartment on the Hogwarts train. Harry asked Ron if he knew where You-Know-Who was. Ron looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. Harry and Ron were on a train from London to Dorset. They were talking about their lives. Harry said he didn't know anything about being a wizard. Ron said he bet he was the worst in the class. Harry and Ron went to the shop to buy candy. The woman didn’t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things. Dumbledore is the greatest wizard of modern times. He is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945. The countryside flying past the window was becoming wilder. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. “Has anyone seen a toad?  Neville’s lost one,” she said. ‘I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn’t work.  I’ll show you, look…’ He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking battered wand. Harry Potter and Ron Weasley met for the first time at school. Harry was stunned to see that Ron had not learned all the course books by heart. “I hope I’m in Gryffindor,” said Ron. Harry Potter was on the train to Hogwarts when the compartment door opened. Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley. The pale boy said his name was Draco Malfoy. Harry and Ron had met Draco Malfoy before in Diagon Alley. He had warned them not to hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid. Harry and Ron were about to leave when they were attacked. Harry and Ron were on their way to Hogwarts when they were stopped. They were told they would be arriving in five minutes' time. Harry and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. The first edition of the book was published in the UK in September 1998. Professor McGonagall led Harry into the Great Hall for the Sorting Ceremony. Harry had never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys. Twenty ghosts had juststreamed through the back wall. They were talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale flickering candlelight. The Sorting Hat tells Harry where he should be placed in the Hogwarts house system. The hat sings: “I’ll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me’ The hat shouted out the house at once, but at other times it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. Harry remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. Harry Potter was chosen for Gryffindor. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. Harry Potter and his friends were introduced to Nearly Headless Nick, the Slytherin ghost who had been trying to behead them. The new Gryffindors were given a feast of ice cream, trifle, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts. The talk turned to their families. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. To order a copy of the book for £12.99, visit www.hodderandstoughton.co.uk. Dumbledore told the students that Quidditch trials would be held in the second week of the term. He also told them that the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side of the Great Hall was out of bounds to everyone who did not wish to die a very painful death. “Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go! ” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,Teach us something please’ Harry and the other first-year Gryffindors were led through the corridors of Hogwarts by Percy. They climbed more staircases, and Harry was just wondering how much more they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the eighth novel in the Harry Potter series. The book is the first in a new series of books about the wizarding world's most famous wizard. Argus Filch, the school's caretaker, was even worse than Peeves. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Harry and Ron were in Defense Against the Dark Arts class with Professor McGonagall. They were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match. Harry had gotten used to owls at breakfast, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead. Snape ignored Hermione’s hand. Harry Potter was in Potions class with the other Gryffindors. Neville managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor. “Idiot boy! ” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. Harry opened his mouth to argue but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. Hagrid let Harry and Ron in to his house. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling. A copper kettle was boiling on the open fire. In the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt. Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call itemptying, taking out that grubby little package. Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note. The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms. “Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up! ’” “UP” everyone shouted. Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. “None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! ” “Did you see his face, the great lump? ” The other Slytherins joined in. Harry grabbed his broom. Harry threw the ball at Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time. Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock. Harry was going to be expelled. Harry thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant. His stomach twisted as he envisioned it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards. He stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag. Harry Potter and Ron Weasley were playing Quidditch for the Beaters. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when Professor McGonagall asked him to join the team. Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. “I start training next week,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. Malfoy offered Harry and Ron a wizard’s duel. “I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. ‘I bet he expected you to refuse,’ said Ron casually, getting back to his cold pie. ”I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying —’ Harry and Ron crept into the Gryffindor common room at half-past eleven. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. Neville was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. “Thank goodness you found me!  I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’tremember the new password to get in to bed. ” “Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but it won”thelp you now, the Fat Lady’S gone off somewhere,” said Harry. Harry, Neville, Ron and Hermione heard Filch talking to Mrs. Norris in the trophy room. “They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, “probably hiding. ” “RUN! ” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following. They ripped through aapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom. Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Peeves ran for their lives through a forbidden corridor. They slammed into a door and it was locked. They heard footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeve’s shouts. They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog. Harry and his friends had to run from the monster to safety. They didn't stop until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. Harry Potter and theorcerer's Stone is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. The book is the first in a series of books about Harry Potter and his friends. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and said, “That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first yearsaren’t allowed them. ” Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow and handed over the broomstick. Harry was given a Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick by McGonagall. The broomstick was shiny, with a mahogany handle and a long tail of straight twigs. Harry flew around the Quidditch field with the broomstick in his hand. Harry Potter and his friends were playing a game of Quidditch at Hogwarts. Harry was given a set of balls to test his knowledge of the game. The Bludgers and the Weasleys were two of the players on each team. The Golden Snitch is the most important ball in Quidditch. It's the Seeker's job to catch it before the other team’s. whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because progressivelyNeville had been trying to catch his eye).  Ron, however, was to be working with decidedlyHermione Granger. Professor Quirrell sprinted into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. He gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know. ” He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. “How could a troll get in? ” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. Harry and Ron crept along the next corridor after Snape’s fading footsteps. “Can you smell something? ” Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils. And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of something huge. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. The troll lumbered around, blinkingstupidly, to see what had made the noise. “Oy, pea-brain! ” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber. The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder. Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck. The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening Harry, Ron and Hermione were playing with a troll in their dormitory. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. Professor McGonagall came bursting into the room, followed by Snape and Quirrell. Harry was speechless. Harry Potter and theorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. The book is the first in a series of books about Harry and Ron Potter. Harry and Ron were playing Quidditch for the first time. Harry had never seen Snape play before. Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match. Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. He told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it. Harry Potter's first Quidditch match was against Slytherin. The team had painted a banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet robes. Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers. Madam Hooch was refereeing. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. “Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid, raising his binoculars. Harry’s broom was behaving strangely. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, ref!  Red card! ” “But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him. Harry's broom started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. “I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look. ” Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop. Gryffindor had won by 100 points to 60. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron andHermione. “It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him. ” “He tried to get pastthat three-headed dog on Halloween.  It bit him. We think he was trying to stealwhatever it's guarding.” Harry Potter and theorcerer's Stone is published by Bloomsbury. The book is the first in a series of books about Harry Potter and his family. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were going to Romania to visit Charlie. When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. “Would you mind moving out of the way? ” came Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them. Harry and Hermione had been searching books for Nicolas Flamel ever since Hagrid had mentioned his name. The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They had been looking for two weeks, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising they had found nothing. Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. Harry and Ron awoke to find a pile of presents on their bed. Harry opened the top parcel and found a wooden flute. He also found a hand-knitted sweater and a box of homemade fudge. Ron opened the next parcel and discovered a very light cloth. Harry Weasley was given an invisibility cloak for Christmas. When he tried it on, his body was completely invisible. He looked down at his feet, but they were gone. A note fell out of the cloak and Harry seized it. The note read: Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce. stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. The invisibility cloak had been sent to Harry by his father. He had to try it, now. Harry crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. Harry thought he heard whispering from the books, as though they knew someone \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0was there who shouldn’t be. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book wasscreaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. Harry saw a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate goldframe, standing on two clawed feet. He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He saw not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, halfjoy, half terrible sadness. The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning. Harry dropped the cloak from around hisshoulders and ran to the mirror. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him. “Do you think this mirror shows the future? ” asked Ron. Harry was so desperate to get to the mirror he didn’t notice Albus Dumbledore. “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. Harry Potter and theorcerer's Stone is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. The book is the first in a new series of Harry Potter books to be published. Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team were desperate to overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Harry was having nightmares when he was tired out after training. The team had almost given up hope of ever finding Nicolas Flamel in a library book. Harry and Ron were playing chess with Hermione and Neville in the Gryffindor common room. Harry told them about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. “Don’t play,” said Hermione at once, “Say you’re ill.” “Pretend to break your leg,’ said Ron. � “Go to Professor McGonagall! ” Hermione urged Neville. Neville shook his head. Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card. “Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever —” “Thanks, Harry…I think I’ll go to bed. …D’you want the card, you \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0collect them, don’t you? ” Neville walked away. ‘I’ve found him! ’ he whispered to Ron and Hermione. ”Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone! ” Harry and Ron were discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. Harry remembered about Snape and thecoming match. He told Ron and Hermione he was going to play in the Quidditch match. Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville. They were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly. “Ron!  Ron! Where are you?  Harry’s won!  We’ve won! ” shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat. Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. The trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. The first edition of the book was published in September 1998. Hermione kept nagging Harry and Ron to study for their exams. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. Harry and Ron went to see gamekeeper Hagrid. They asked him what was guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy. Hagrid said he didn’t know. Hagrid is the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. “Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” he proudly said. Hagrid had written only two words: It’s hatching. The egg was lying on the table, with deep cracks in it. “How many times in our lives are we going to see a dragonipienthatching? ” Harry whispered. Harry, Ron, and Hermione spent most of their free time in Hagrid’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him. “Isn’t he beautiful? ” Hagrid murmured as he reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head. The color suddenly drained from his face and he leapt to his feet and ran to the window. Harry and Hermione were sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s invisibility cloak. Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him. Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed. “Oh no oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book Malfoy took,” said Harry. Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down, but this didn’t help. Harry and Hermione had to carry Norbert to Hagrid's hut in the middle of the night. Hagrid had packed Norbert in a large crate. Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. The book is available in hardback and paperback. The first edition of the book was published in September 1997. Professor McGonagall found Hermione, Harry and Neville out of bed in the dark. They'd told a cock-and-bull story about a dragon to get Draco Malfoy to bed. The story had been a ruse to get Longbottom to go looking for them. The three students were given 50 points each for their actions. Harry Potter was one of the most popular and admired people at the school. He was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him. Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business. Harry heard Quirrell sob as he left the classroom. He went back to the library and told Hermione and Ron what he'd heard. Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't. Harry told them what he’d heard. Harry, Hermione, and Neville were sent detention notes the next morning. They were delivered by Mr. Filch, who leered at them as he led them outside. He said they would spend the night in the forest, where they would be punished. Hagrid and Filch had been waiting for Harry and Hermione for half an hour. They were in the middle of a forest when they saw the werewolves. Hagrid led them to the very edge of the forest, where they saw a unicorn. Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right. They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then aray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood. Harry and Hermione were walking through the forest when they saw something move. Hagrid called out: “Show yerself — I’m armed! ” And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse? A man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut body. Hagrid raised his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan. “There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it? ” Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan and looked skyward. ‘Mars is decidedlybright tonight,’ he said simply. ”We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily.  “Well, if either of you do see anythin' let me Malfoy, Neville, and Fang set off into the heart of the forest with Harry. Harry had never seenanything so beautiful and sad. A hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some pursuing beast. The cloaked figure lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and lowered itsHead over the wounds. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead. “You are the Potter boy,” he said. ‘You had better get back to Hagrid.’ Firenze asked Harry what unicorn blood was used for. Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a monstrous thing,” said Firenze. Harry Potter and his friends returned from the forest to find the unicorn dead. Hagrid and Firenze were waiting for them in the forest. Harry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. The book is available in hardback, paperback and e-book. Harry and Ron were playing in the shallows with Lee Jordan. Harry had an unsettled feeling about something he'd forgotten to do. He saw an owl flutter toward the school with a note in its mouth. He told Ron and Hermione to go see Hagrid. Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house, shelling peas into a large bowl. He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. “I shouldn’ta told yeh that! ” he blurted out. ‘Forget I said it!’ Harry and Ron had never been told where Professor Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. “We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, “See Professor Dumbledore? ” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. ”Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time – ” Harry and Ron were in the staff room when they heard Snape's voice. He told them he was going through the trapdoor tonight. They were told to keep an eye on Snape and follow him. Harry and Ron went back to the common room. “I’m going to try and get to the Stone first. ” “You can’t! ” said Hermione, “After what McGonagall and Snape have said?  You’ll be expelled! ’ “SO WHAT” Harry shouted. After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. “Go on then, try and hit me! ” said Neville, raising his fists. Hermione raised her wand and said “Petrificus Totalus! ’ Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. He swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as aboard. Harry and his friends had to fight their way to the third-floor trapdoor. The door was already ajar, and they could hear rumbling growls coming from inside. Harry had a sudden idea. He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. The beast's eyes began to droop and it slumped to the ground. Harry and Hermione had to jump through a trapdoor to get to the other side. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. “I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the dog's back. ‘Want to go first, Hermione? ’ said Harry. Hermione and Harry were trapped under the school by a plant. They struggled to free themselves as the plant wrapped itself around them. Hermione used her wand to send a jet of bluebell flames at the plant. The plant loosened its grip and they were able to escape. Harry, Hermione and Ron heard soft rustling and clinking coming from up ahead. They saw a chamber full of small,jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. Harry sprinted across the room, expecting to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him. But nothing happened. Harry, Hermione and Ron were trapped in a dark chamber with no way out. Harry spotted a key that had been caught and stuffed into a keyhole. The key had a bent wing and was flying away from them. Harry raced after it and pinned it against a stone wall. A light flooded the room and they saw a huge chessboard. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were playing chess. They had to take the place of three of the black pieces. Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. “I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron. Harry and Hermione had to fight their way through a maze of corridors to reach the Stone. They had already fought Sprout's, Flitwick's, McGonagall's and Quirrell's spells. Now they had to face Snape's - but he had the Stone himself. Harry and Hermione were trapped in a room with seven bottles of poison and wine. They had to choose which bottle would get them through the black fire and which one would take them back to the Stone. Hermione found a piece of paper lying next to the bottles. She read the clues four times before deciding which bottle to drink. Harry Potter and theorcerer's Stone is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. The first edition of the book was published in the UK in 1998. Professor Quirrell was standing in front of the Mirror of Erised. Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't. “But Snape tried to kill me! ” “No, no, no. I tried to killing you. ” Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give. He blurted out, “I saw you and Snape in the forest —” “Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. “He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got.  He suspected \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0me all along.  Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I had Lord \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Voldemort on my side…. ” Harry Potter wanted to find the Sorcerer's Stone before Quirrell did. If he looked in the mirror, he should see himself finding it, he thought. But how can I look without Quirrel realizing what I’m up to? Harry closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again. He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first, but a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to wrap his turban. The turban fell away. Harry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound. The evil face was now smiling. Harry was pinned to the ground by Quirrell. Voldemort screamed, “Seize him!  SEIZE HIM! ” Harry could see his hands blistering before his eyes. He tried to catch the Snitch, but it was a pair of glasses. Harry awoke in a hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. “ tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, beaming. Dumbledore told Harry that even if the Stone’s gone, even if You-Know-Who is still out there somewhere. Harry asked, “Why couldn’t Quirrell touch me? ” “Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot comprehend, it is love. ” “To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0protection forever. ” “And the invisibility cloak — do you know who sent it to me? ” Harry said, “Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it. ’ ‘ “How did I get the Stone out of the mirror? ’ Harry asked. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. After a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal. “I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. ”Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,’ she said stiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky the end-of-year feast could be.” “Oh, good,“ said Harry, “Who is it? ” Hagrid sidled through the door as he Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup. The Great Hall was already full. Slytherin had won the house cup for the seventh year in a row. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. Harry Potter and his friends traveled through the Muggle world on the Hogwarts Express. They were reunited with Professor McGonagall at King’s Cross Station. Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but they did. Ginny Weasley squealed, “Harry Potter! ” “Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point. ” Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still lookingfurious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.\""
